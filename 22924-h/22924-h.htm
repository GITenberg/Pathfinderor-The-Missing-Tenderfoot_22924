<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>THE BIRCH-BARK MESSAGE.</h3>


<p>"Hold on, boys; here's a stick standing upright in the
trail. And look, fellows, there's a piece of nice new
birch bark held fast in the cloven end, that grips it like
the jaws of a vise."</p>

<p>"Say, it's a message, all right."</p>

<p>"And from our crack-a-jack pathfinder, Elmer Chenowith,
too, I warrant you."</p>

<p>"What do you say, Matty? Is Red Huggins right?"</p>

<p>Seven boys had come to a halt in the heart of the big
woods. They were a rather husky-looking set, all told,
and evidently bent on getting all the benefit possible from
being outdoors through the last few weeks of vacation time.</p>

<p>The one appealed to, Matty Eggleston by name, was
something of a leader among the Hickory Ridge Troop of
Boy Scouts.</p>

<p>In fact, he was at the head of the Beaver Patrol, and
studying constantly in order to attain the rank of a first-class
scout.</p>

<p>There are so very many things a boy must know in order<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
to reach this ambition that comparatively few scouts ever
attain it. But by concentrating all his energies upon one
particular study he may earn a merit badge, which it
will make him proud to wear.</p>

<p>Matty took the piece of bark from the cloven stick. The
other six boys clustered eagerly around, anxious to see
what sort of message it could be that the assistant scout
master had left in the trail.</p>

<p>They were out to try a new experience, and one that appealed
to every boy in the bunch.</p>

<p>A party of the scouts, their identity and number unknown
to Elmer and the balance, had started off for the
woods early in the day.</p>

<p>An hour later, Elmer, with one companion, had taken up
the trail, and when a second hour had elapsed the balance
of those who were bent upon playing the game left town in
two detachments.</p>

<p>It had been arranged that Elmer was to act as pathfinder
and tracker. He would in turn leave a plain trail that a
child could follow.</p>

<p>Besides this, he had promised to transmit from time to
time some sort of message. Thus those who came along in
the rear, in two detachments, would be kept in touch with
events, and also advised as to what they should do.</p>

<p>The party bringing up the rear was headed by Mark
Cummings, who was Elmer's particular chum. He was
really the bugler of the troop; but for this occasion Elmer
himself carried that instrument, with the idea of calling
the scouts together at some time later on.</p>

<p>"Hey, look at that, would you; it's all marked up with
crow's feet tracks!" exclaimed Landy Smith, a rather fat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
boy who had only recently joined the Wolf Patrol, making
the eighth and last member.</p>

<p>"What's Elmer think we are, a lot of kids, to leave us
an illustrated rebus to guess? Looks to me like a little
boy's first try to draw cows and Noah's Ark people."</p>

<p>Some of the others laughed when George Robbins gave
expression to his disgust in this way. George was a cousin
to Landy, and had also recently signed the muster roll of
the scouts, although he belonged to Matty's patrol, the
Beaver.</p>

<p>"You've got a heap to learn yet, George," said Red
Huggins, shaking his head at the offender.</p>

<p>"In what way?" demanded the other.</p>

<p>"Why, this is what they call Injun picture writing,"
replied Red, obligingly.</p>

<p>"Oh! it is, eh? But what's that got to do with finding
a trail, or following one that's already found?" asked the
latest tenderfoot.</p>

<p>"A heap, as you'll soon learn, my boy," replied Red,
with a pitying look, as if he could not understand how
anyone should be so green. "Matty, suppose you enlighten
him a little, won't you&mdash;that is, if you've got
through reading your letter?"</p>

<p>"Letter!" ejaculated both Landy and George&mdash;"that
thing a letter?"</p>

<p>"A short and sweet one," remarked Matty. "You see,
Elmer has signed it with what I make out to be the paw of
a wolf. That's the totem of his patrol, while mine is a
beaver tail, and the third one would be the claw of an
eagle."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Say, that sounds kind of interesting like," observed
Landy. "I rather expect I'll cotton to this same Injun
picture writing letter business, once I get at the secret key
of it."</p>

<p>"That's where you're away off to start with, Landy,"
remarked Matty, laughing, "because you see there's nothing
hidden about this business at all. In fact, the one particular
idea with the one who writes a message in Indian
picture writing is to make it so simple a child might understand."</p>

<p>"Well, I declare," cried the fat scout, who was not in
khaki uniform like four of his companions, simply because
he and George were waiting until the town tailor, father
to Jasper Merriweather, one of the members of the troop,
could complete their suits&mdash;"then, if a baby could understand
what our pathfinder has left for us, perhaps now
there might be some chance for me."</p>

<p>"Oh! it's as easy as falling off a log, once you get the
hang of it," declared Larry Billings.</p>

<p>"Look here, and I'll show you, fellows," remarked
Matty, holding the bark up so that everyone present could
see the lead-pencil marks.</p>

<p>"Looks like several men, to start with," interposed
George.</p>

<p>"Good enough, George," said the patrol leader, "and
that's just what they are. Count them, will you?"</p>

<p>"One, two, three."</p>

<p>"That's right. So you see, to begin with, our pathfinder
tells us the enemy ahead are three in number. Now,
do you see anything close by those three figures of men?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and Matty held the bark directly in front of Landy and
George.</p>

<p>"Sure," replied George. "Under one is a mark&mdash;say,
it looks like the same down at the bottom of the letter, and
you said that was the sign or totem of the Wolf Patrol."</p>

<p>"Just so; and this tells us the first fellow is a member
of that patrol. Under the others you will see marks to indicate
that they are members of the Beaver and the Eagle
patrols."</p>

<p>"That's so, Matty; I can see 'em," declared Landy,
who evidently did not wish his cousin to get all the credit
for smartness.</p>

<p>"All right. Let's get on a little," said Matty. "First
notice two have hats on, while the third wears none. Now,
you may think that an accident in drawing, but it isn't at
all. Elmer meant it for something."</p>

<p>"And I can guess what it is," declared Chatz Maxfield,
the Southern boy.</p>

<p>"Then tell the rest of us," cried several.</p>

<p>"Why, it's dead easy," was his reply. "Stop and think;
who's always losing his hat every chance he gets?"</p>

<p>"Nat Scott!" quickly exclaimed Landy.</p>

<p>"All right. And don't we happen to know that Nat was
one of those who went ahead of Elmer and Lil Artha by an
hour or so," laughed Red.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare!" cried Landy, "and do you mean
to say Elmer has guessed that, or did he see the fellows before
he wrote this letter?"</p>

<p>"Neither one nor the other. He just figured it out
from something he found. Perhaps he knows what the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
print of Nat's shoe looks like, for we all make different
tracks, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Chatz, "that would be just like Elmer.
He's the most observing, wide-awake fellow I ever knew
since I came up from the South. I've seen him measuring
some of our tracks, and making a copy in that wonderful
little book of his."</p>

<p>"Now, let's get on a little further. Do you see that
the second figure, no matter how often he appears, always
has his left leg bent a little?" and Matty pointed in
several places to confirm his statement.</p>

<p>Immediately Red laughed aloud, and then in one breath
he and Larry exclaimed:</p>

<p>"That's Ty Collins, as sure as anything!"</p>

<p>"I guess you've hit the mark," said Matty, "and that
was just what Elmer was trying to tell us. Ty's left leg
has always been a little crooked since he fell out of that
cherry tree three years ago. Now, the third fellow got me
at first, but come to look at him he seems a little different
from the others. See here, and here, and here."</p>

<p>"That's a fact," declared Landy, scratching his nose in
a way he had when puzzled.</p>

<p>"He can't mean he's a dead one, and sprouting wings,
can he?" asked George.</p>

<p>"Wings! I've got it, fellows!" shouted Red.</p>

<p>"Then pass it around to the rest, because I'm all up a
stump," observed Larry.</p>

<p>"Shucks! don't you know there's only one fellow in
the whole troop who's always sighing because he can't fly,
and wishes he had wings?" demanded Red, promptly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Toby Jones, the boy who's bent on sailing through the
clouds some day!" cried Chatz.</p>

<p>"Exactly," remarked Matty. "And in this clever
way our pathfinder has told us who the three scouts ahead
are. Now he shows them coming to a fork in the trail.
One goes to the north, and the others to the northwest.
Which party can be carrying the wampum belt we expect
to trace down?"</p>

<p>All of them looked again, and while several shook their
heads Red remarked:</p>

<p>"Seems to me one of the two that kept together fell
down just at the fork of the trail. Was that only an accident,
Matty, or a part of the play?"</p>

<p>"I believe it was done on purpose," the other replied.
"Because, if you look closely, you'll find that the one who
stretched out on the ground was Ty, and that from that
time on he has a funny little wiggly line drawn around his
waist."</p>

<p>"Sure, he has. That must be the wampum belt," exclaimed
Red.</p>

<p>"Yes. No doubt he was instructed by our scout master,
Mr. Garrabrant, that when they separated the fellow carrying
the belt must do <i>something</i> to show it. That was a
clever dodge of Ty's to lie down, and make an impression
in the earth."</p>

<p>"Yes, and smarter yet for Elmer to discover the impression,
and read it," declared Chatz.</p>

<p>"What else does the letter say?" asked Landy, who
seemed quite enthused now, after discovering how exceedingly
interesting this communicating by means of Indian
picture writing might become.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Elmer tries to tell us he is pursuing the two who headed
northwest. You see he has made an arrow showing this
fact," Matty continued.</p>

<p>"But there are some other marks; can you make them
out at all?" asked Landy.</p>

<p>"This is certainly a fire. Before separating, the three
enemies built a fire and pretended to feed. Here they are
sitting around the blaze and eating; and if you look over
yonder right now, you'll see the ashes where the fire has
been."</p>

<p>All of them hurried across to where Matty pointed.</p>

<p>"By all that's wonderful, there has been a camp fire
here," said Landy.</p>

<p>"You're a little off there, Landy," corrected the leader
of the Beaver Patrol; "this was only a little cooking blaze,
not a camp fire."</p>

<p>"But what's the difference?" demanded the new recruit;
"I thought a fire must be a fire."</p>

<p>"Well," said Matty, "when hunters are in a hostile
country and want to prepare a meal they dig a hole and
make a small blaze in it that will be hot enough for their
purpose, but which might not be seen fifty feet away."</p>

<p>"And a camp fire?" continued the novice.</p>

<p>"Quite a different matter. That is generally a rousing
blaze made for comfort, and at a time when no danger is
feared. This was only a cooking fire," Matty went on to
explain, as he again thrust the "message" into the jaws
of the cloven stick.</p>

<p>"Do you know how long ago this fire was made?" asked
George.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"The ashes are cold now, but they must have been warm
when Elmer was here. He says so&mdash;anyhow, that's the way
I read it. Here are four hands held up. Counting fingers
and thumbs he wants us to know he has gained on the
enemy, and was only twenty minutes behind when they
separated at this fire."</p>

<p>"Well, that takes the cake!" ejaculated Landy, whose
whole appearance indicated amazement.</p>

<p>"I wonder if it's going to turn out so?" remarked
George, who was always unbelieving, and hence sometimes
called by his friends "Doubting George."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll prove it later," said Matty, "because I
am putting all these things down in my record. When we
come together Elmer will tell us what he meant, and read
our answers out loud. Then well see how that second
squad come out. But let's be on the move again, fellows.
Plenty to do before we overhaul our pathfinder, and find
out if he secured the wampum belt. Come along, everybody!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>AT THE HAUNTED MILL.</h3>


<p>Once more the little squad of scouts resumed their forward
movement.</p>

<p>Matty remained at their head, as before. This game
was growing more delightful to him every minute, and
some of the others were feeling the same way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course it was easy work for those who came after,
and the second bunch, headed by Mark Cummings, would
have, as Red expressed it, a "snap."</p>

<p>The real work of following the trail was falling upon
Elmer and his companion, the tall, angular fellow known
among his mates as Lil Artha.</p>

<p>In carrying out the purpose of the game they were to do
all the reading of the signs, and leave a plain track for
those who came after. But the two detachments of scouts
were expected to pick up as much knowledge concerning
the methods used as they could.</p>

<p>Besides this, they must read the messages left occasionally
by their pathfinder.</p>

<p>For quite some time the boys scurried along. More than
once they had to quicken their pace to what Matty called
a "dog-trot." This happened especially when the
"signs" were very plain.</p>

<p>"Why all this haste?" asked Landy, who seemed to be
puffing a little, because of his being rather a stout boy,
and not very well up in athletics.</p>

<p>"Because we want to gain on Elmer when we have the
chance," replied the leader.</p>

<p>"But look here, Matty," said Landy, "do you mean to
tell me Elmer is getting along about as fast as we've been
doing, when he has a blind trail to follow, and we have a
plain one?"</p>

<p>"Looks like it, don't it?" exclaimed Red.</p>

<p>"But how under the sun does he do it?" pursued the
doubting greenhorn.</p>

<p>"Well," Matty went on, "Elmer lived in Canada, away<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
up where our blizzards come from. He used to ride a
wild broncho, throw a rope, hunt antelope and wolves, and
was once in at the death of a big grizzly bear that had been
playing hob with their cattle."</p>

<p>"Yes, I've heard all that," admitted Landy.</p>

<p>"So you see he learned a lot about following a trail that
would never be seen by any fellows like us scouts. He
knows a dozen signs that tell him the facts. And when
greenhorns like Ty, Nat, and Toby try to fool him, why, he
just eats the trail up."</p>

<p>Matty, as he finished speaking, came to a sudden pause.</p>

<p>"We might as well take a breathing spell," he remarked,
"because we're getting pretty close to the meeting place
anyhow. Besides, here's a chance for me to show you
how Elmer manages."</p>

<p>The others crowded around, eager to see for themselves
what object lesson Matty expected to lay before them.</p>

<p>"Now I want you to notice right here," he said, pointing
to the ground, "that the footprints of the two boys
ahead suddenly stop. Here are the plain marks left purposely
by Elmer and Lil Artha. Do you notice how they
run alongside this fallen tree?"</p>

<p>"That's a fact," declared George, as all of them walked
slowly along.</p>

<p>"The two foxes in the lead thought to puzzle the hounds
by jumping on this long log, and running its entire length,"
said Matty, with a grin, "but they had their trouble for
nothing. Why, it was such an old trick that Elmer guessed
it at a glance. He must have gained quite a lot on 'em
here."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>George and Landy exchanged glances.</p>

<p>"Well, there's a heap more in this game than I ever
thought of," admitted the latter.</p>

<p>"Don't see how he does it," remarked George, with a
doubting shake of his head.</p>

<p>"Oh, the more you study up on this thing," said Red,
"the better you'll like it. No end of clever stunts that
can be engineered. But see here, Matty, didn't you say
we must be getting near the place where we expected to
round up both foxes and hounds?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm looking to hear the bugle any minute right
now," replied the leader.</p>

<p>"Where was it fixed for?" asked Landy.</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought you knew," Matty replied, as they once
more took up the broad trail, at the point beyond the end of
the fallen tree.</p>

<p>"I heard some talk about an old mill, but didn't pay
much attention to it," remarked Landy, carelessly.</p>

<p>"Then you've got to turn over a new leaf, old fellow,
if you expect to ever succeed as a good scout," Red broke
in with.</p>

<p>"How's that?" demanded Landy.</p>

<p>"Because," replied the red-headed lad, himself always
wide-awake and on the alert, "a scout to succeed must forever
keep his wits about him and observe things. In fact,
Elmer says he should take as a motto, besides the words
'Be Prepared' the old sign you see at railroad crossings."</p>

<p>"Stop! look! listen!" exclaimed Matty, Larry, and
Chatz in chorus.</p>

<p>"I suppose I <i>am</i> somewhat sleepy," grumbled Landy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
"but perhaps some day I'll surprise you wide-awake Slim
Jims by doing something real smart. But tell me more
about this mill."</p>

<p>"You sure must have heard of Munsey's mill?" remarked
Matty.</p>

<p>"Oh, I believe it does sound kind of familiar, but then
I must have forgotten all I ever heard about it," Landy
confessed.</p>

<p>Red and Matty exchanged glances, and shook their heads
mournfully. It seemed a pretty tough proposition to ever
expect to make a good and profitable scout out of such poor
material.</p>

<p>"Well," said the patrol leader, "there is a long story
connected with the old ramshackle mill. No use of my going
into all the details. It's been abandoned a good many
years now. People have tried to live there three times
since old Munsey was found dead there, but they had to
give it up."</p>

<p>"Yes, suh," Chatz broke in, his eyes shining brightly,
for this was a subject that appealed very strongly to
him, "they just couldn't hold out. Got cold feet after going
through the experience and had to quit."</p>

<p>"But why?" demanded Landy.</p>

<p>"Because they declared the old mill was haunted!" replied
Matty.</p>

<p>"Yes, suh, it was haunted," echoed Chatz.</p>

<p>The Southern boy had always confessed to a streak of
superstition in his make-up. He admitted that he must
have imbibed it from association with the ignorant little
negro lads with whom he had been accustomed to play down
on the plantation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>He had even admitted once to carrying in his pocket, as a
charm, the left hind foot of a rabbit, which animal had been
killed by himself in a graveyard when the moon was full.</p>

<p>The boys plagued Chatz so much that he had by degrees
shown signs of considering most of his former beliefs as
folly.</p>

<p>Still, the mere mention of a haunted house set his nerves
to quivering. Chatz might be a timid fellow when up
against anything bordering upon the ghostly, but on all
other occasions he had proven himself brave, almost to the
point of rashness.</p>

<p>It was "Doubting George" who burst out into a harsh
laugh.</p>

<p>"A haunted house!" he exclaimed. "Ghosts! Strange
knockings! Thrilling whispers! Ice-cold hands! Oh,
my, what a lark! I've always wanted to get up against a
thing like that. Don't believe in 'em the least bit. You
could talk to me till you was gray-headed, and I'd just
laugh. There never was such things as ghosts, never!"</p>

<p>Chatz looked at him rather queerly.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, perhaps you're right, George," he said, holding
himself in check, "but I've read of some people who
had pretty rough experiences."</p>

<p>"Rats! They fooled themselves every time," declared
the boy who would not believe. "Bet you it was the wind
whistling through a knot hole, or a parcel of rats squeaking
and fighting between the walls. Ghosts! It makes me
laugh."</p>

<p>"Same here," declared Red.</p>

<p>"Listen!" exclaimed Larry just then, making them all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
start. Through the timber ahead of them came the sweet
clear notes of a bugle.</p>

<p>"Told you so, fellows," declared Matty, smiling;
"that's Elmer. He's learning to use the bugle nearly as
well as Mark himself."</p>

<p>"Then we're at the end of our trail following, are we?"
asked Landy, not without a sigh of relief, for it had not
been as easy work in his case as with his less stout comrades.</p>

<p>"Well, pretty near," Matty replied. "We've got to
keep it up till we come in sight of the mill."</p>

<p>"But why?" asked George, who seemed to want to know
every little thing, so that his natural tendency to object
might have a chance to show itself.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, there might be one more opening for a message,
and our main business is to translate these, you know."</p>

<p>"Do we stay long at the old mill?" asked Chatz.</p>

<p>Red gave him a quick, suspicious look.</p>

<p>"Aw, I reckon I know what's on our comrade's mind,"
he remarked, with a wink.</p>

<p>"As what?" demanded Landy.</p>

<p>"Chatz thinks he'd like to prowl around some, and see
if that ghost has left any signs. 'Tain't often he's had a
chance to meet up with a real haunted house, eh, Chatz?"
and Red gave the Southern boy a sly dig in the ribs.</p>

<p>"Never had that pleasure in all my life, fellows, I assure
you," replied the Southern boy, with ill-concealed delight
in his manner.</p>

<p>"But say, no respectable ghost was ever known to walk
except at midnight, and we don't intend camping out at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the old mill, do we, just because of this silly talk?" asked
George.</p>

<p>"Oh, the rest of us don't, but Chatz might take a notion
to stay over," laughed Red. "When a fellow is set on
investigating things he don't understand, and which were
never meant for us to understand, there's just no telling
how far he will carry the game."</p>

<p>Chatz gave him a lofty look.</p>

<p>"Thank you for the compliment, suh," he said.</p>

<p>They continued to follow the "spoor" of the two
hounds, left so plainly for their guidance.</p>

<p>It was not long before another stick that held a bark
"message" was discovered. And Landy felt immensely
elated to think that by some chance he had been the first to
see the "sign."</p>

<p>"I'll surprise you fellows yet, just mark me," he chuckled,
while Matty was trying to read the queer little characters
Elmer had marked upon the brown inner side of the
fresh bark torn from a convenient tree close by.</p>

<p>"Wish you would, old top," remarked Red, with his
customary enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"You'll get to like all these things more and more, the
farther you go," said Larry.</p>

<p>"I feel that way already," was Landy's quick reply;
"only I'm that clumsy and slow-witted I just don't see
how I'm ever going to keep up with the procession."</p>

<p>"Elmer says it's only keeping everlastingly at it that
makes a good scout," remarked Chatz.</p>

<p>Evidently, from the way these boys continually quoted
"Elmer," the assistant scout master must be a very popular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
fellow in Hickory Ridge, and those who have made a
study of boy nature can understand what rare elements
the said Elmer must have in his composition to make so
many friends and so few enemies.</p>

<p>"Come around and see what I've made out of this message,"
said Matty just then.</p>

<p>It proved to be the concluding communication, and in
plain picture language informed those for whom it was
left that the two foxes had stopped here, made a dense
smoke to attract their missing comrade, and when joined
by him, the three had gone on together to the rendezvous
at the old mill.</p>

<p>"Fine," cried Landy, when he heard what a remarkable
story those rude drawings told.</p>

<p>"Very good&mdash;if true," admitted George.</p>

<p>"Well, come along and we'll prove it," laughed
Matty; "for unless I miss my guess the mill is close by."</p>

<p>"Sure," declared Red. "I can hear the noise of water
tumbling down some rocks, or over a mill dam."</p>

<p>Five minutes later and Chatz called out:</p>

<p>"There you are, suh!"</p>

<p>The mill could be seen through the trees, and all of the
boys felt the greatest eagerness to hurry along and reach
this spot.</p>

<p>It happened that none of this bunch had ever set eyes
on Munsey's mill, or the pond just above it. There were
plenty of places nearer Hickory Ridge for fishing purposes.
And besides, the dear familiar old "swimming hole" was
more convenient than this place, nearly seven miles away.</p>

<p>"I see Elmer and Lil Artha," observed Larry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, and there's another fellow just beyond. I reckon
it must be Ty Collins," said Chatz.</p>

<p>Elmer waited for them to come up. He and his companions
were standing on the edge of the dam which had
long ago been built in order to hold up the water and form
the big lonely looking pond beyond.</p>

<p>"Ugh, what a spooky looking place this is!" exclaimed
Larry, as soon as they drew up where they could look out
on the big pond, its surface in places partly covered with
lily plants, and the long trailing branches of weeping willows
dipping down to the water.</p>

<p>"It sure is, suh!" remarked Chatz, plainly interested,
and not a little excited.</p>

<p>"Here we are, Elmer," called out Matty; "and I guess
the second bunch will be along soon. I see Ty and Toby,
but where's Nat Scott?"</p>

<p>Elmer gave him a serious look.</p>

<p>"That's just what we're wondering," he said. "They
all reached the old mill, you see, but Nat seems to have
disappeared in a mighty queer way!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>THE STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE OF NAT.</h3>


<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>Chatz was the only one who gave utterance to a sound
after Elmer had made this surprising, as well as alarming,
admission.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>The others were looking, first at Elmer, then at each of
his three companions as well; and finally out upon the dismal
pond that assumed much the appearance of a lake, it
stretched so far up the valley, almost a quarter of a mile,
in fact.</p>

<p>Just then the only sound they heard was the noisy scolding
of the water as it went over the spill or apron of the
stout dam that had stood all these long years, defying
floods and the ravages of time.</p>

<p>And somehow, there was something chilling in the very
lonesome character of their surroundings.</p>

<p>Of the ten scouts present, Chatz seemed to be the only
one who did not look solemn. There was an eager glow in
the Southern boy's dark eyes, as though the situation appealed
to that element of superstition in his nature.</p>

<p>And Elmer, noting this expression, that was almost of
glee, knew that when the companions of Chatz fondly believed
they had cured him of his silly faith in ghosts and
such things, they had made a mistake. The snake had only
been "scotched," not killed. It was already awakening
again, under the first favorable conditions.</p>

<p>"Say, this ain't any part of the game, is it?" demanded
Red.</p>

<p>"Yes, you don't expect us to guess what's become of
Nat, and then find him grinning at us, perhaps astraddle of
a limb up in a big tree?" remarked Larry.</p>

<p>"I asked these fellows," said Elmer, seriously, "and
both Toby and Ty gave me their word of honor that no
game or joke was set up between them. If Nat is playing
a prank then he's doing it on his own account."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"And Nat ain't generally the fellow to think of playing
a joke on his chums," declared Larry.</p>

<p>"Gee, this is getting wild and woolly now!" remarked
Landy; "I'm all of a tremble. What if the poor fellow
fell over this dam here, struck his head on a rock, and lies
right now at the bottom of that black pool where the foam
keeps on circling around and around. Ugh! It makes
me shiver, fellows, honest and truly."</p>

<p>George, as usual, scoffed at the idea of anything having
happened to Nat Scott.</p>

<p>"He'll show up as soon as he feels like it, make sure of
that," he declared.</p>

<p>"Have you called him!" asked Matty.</p>

<p>"Yes, all of us did," replied Lil Artha, whose customary
rollicking good nature seemed subdued in a measure for
once.</p>

<p>"And he didn't answer?" demanded Chatz.</p>

<p>"We never heard a word, and that's a fact, boys," declared
Toby Jones, uneasily.</p>

<p>Then they all looked around again, their eyes naturally
roving in the quarter where, near the farther end of the
dam, the old mill stood.</p>

<p>Its day was long since past. The great water wheel at
the end of the sluice had partly fallen to pieces with the
passage of time and the ravages of neglect. What was left
seemed to be almost entirely covered with green moss,
among which the clear little fingers of water trickled.</p>

<p>Suddenly a discordant scream rang out. It was so fearful
that several of the fellows turned pale, and all of them
started violently.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"There!" ejaculated Chatz.</p>

<p>His manner was almost triumphant; just as though he
would like to demand whether these chums of his could
not find some reason to believe as he did, after such a
manifestation.</p>

<p>"Oh, glory, what was that!" quivered Landy, as he
clutched the arm of Elmer Chenowith.</p>

<p>"But it didn't come from the mill," declared Larry.
"Sounded to me like it was out there on the pond."</p>

<p>"Good for you, Larry," remarked Elmer.</p>

<p>"Then I was right?" asked the other.</p>

<p>"You certainly were, and if the whole of you turn your
eyes aways up yonder, perhaps you'll notice a big black-and-white
bird come to the surface. It dived just after
scolding us for disturbing its fishing excursion."</p>

<p>Following the direction indicated by Elmer's extended
finger the scouts all watched eagerly.</p>

<p>"I see something moving just behind that bunch of lily
pads," exclaimed one with keen vision.</p>

<p>"There it swims out now, and it's a big water bird, too.
Looks like a goose to me," Landy remarked, earnestly.</p>

<p>"That's a loon, fellows!" exclaimed Red.</p>

<p>"Is it, Elmer?" they demanded in a breath.</p>

<p>"Just what it is, and nothing else," replied the acting
scout master. "They are very common up in the Great
Northwest. And once you've heard their wild laugh you'll
never forget it."</p>

<p>"Huh, sounds just like the shout of a crazy man to me,"
ventured Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"Everybody says that," Elmer declared. "And I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
never knew a single fellow who liked to hear a loon call.
Some say it's a sign of ill luck to be scolded by a loon."</p>

<p>"Ill luck!" echoed Chatz, once more looking in the direction
of the ramshackle old mill.</p>

<p>"But see here," remarked Matty, "tell us about Nat,
won't you? When was his queer disappearance first
noticed, Elmer?"</p>

<p>"Well, when Lil Artha and myself arrived here we found
Toby and Ty throwing stones out in the pond, scaring the
little red-marked turtles that were sitting by dozens on
every old log and rock, and great big bullfrogs as well."</p>

<p>"Never saw so many whopping big frogs in all my life,"
declared Ty.</p>

<p>"You see," explained Toby, "we missed Nat, but
thought he had just wandered off to look around. Ty and
me, why, we felt too tired to explore things till the rest
came along."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you could amuse yourselves throwing things
into the water, eh?" Matty remarked, with such a vein
of sarcasm in his voice that Toby immediately aroused to
defend himself.</p>

<p>"'Twa'n't that at all, Matty Eggleston; prove it by
Ty here if either of us was afraid to go inside your old
haunted mill, was we, Ty?" he exclaimed, with a fine show
of righteous indignation.</p>

<p>"Course we wasn't," Ty hastened to declare, with a decided
shake of his tousled head. "We walked along the
shore till we came to a nice shady place, and then squatted
down, meanin' to wait till Elmer showed up. Then I
popped a rock at a sassy little turkle, and pretty soon both
of us were letting fly."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"When did you miss Nat, and where was he the last you
saw him?" asked Matty, who was expected some day to
become a lawyer.</p>

<p>"Oh!" answered Toby, "he said he'd hang around
the dam here and look into things. You know Nat always
did want to pry into everything he saw."</p>

<p>"What then?" Matty went on asking.</p>

<p>"Why, we saw Elmer and Lil Artha coming, and went
to meet 'em, that's all," replied Ty.</p>

<p>"Have any of you been inside the mill?"</p>

<p>"Why, no," Toby spoke up. "Elmer and Lil Artha
sat down to rest, and you see we expected Nat to pop out
on us any minute, so we just didn't say anything about it
till they asked."</p>

<p>"And that was just about the time we first heard your
voices close by," said Elmer, "so we made up our minds
to wait till you joined us, when we could scatter and
search."</p>

<p>"Search!" echoed Larry. "Good gracious! do you
think Nat can be lost?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem possible," admitted Elmer, "but I
blew the bugle, and sounded the assembly. If Nat heard
that he is scout enough to know it was a command for him
to come in&mdash;if he could."</p>

<p>"Whew! this is something we didn't expect to run up
against&mdash;a mystery right in the start," remarked Matty,
mopping his face with his big bandana handkerchief, which
he wore about his neck, cowboy fashion, with the knot behind.</p>

<p>"You never can tell, suh!" said Chatz, in a solemn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
manner; and somehow none of the boys seemed quite as
ready to scoff at the Southerner's superstitious belief, as
usual.</p>

<p>"But hadn't we better be looking around?" remarked
Matty. "Nat may have gone into the old mill, bent on
investigating, and some accident have happened to him."</p>

<p>"As what?" queried George, cautiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, perhaps he tripped and fell, striking his
head as he went down. Then again, a rotten plank might
have given way under him, and let him get an ugly fall,"
Matty replied.</p>

<p>"That sounds reasonable enough," said Elmer, "and
now I want some of you to scatter around and see if you
can discover any trace of our missing comrade. Red, you
get a long pole and poke down in that deep pool, though I
feel pretty sure you won't find any sign of him there, because
there isn't a mark of blood on the rocks, as there
would be if he had fallen from up here on the dam."</p>

<p>The boys looked aghast.</p>

<p>Up to this point perhaps Landy and several others may
have indulged in a hope that after all perhaps this might
only be a little finish to the remarkable game of fox and
hounds which they had been playing.</p>

<p>Indeed, Red and Larry had once or twice even exchanged
sly winks. They actually suspected that Elmer had secretly
ordered Nat to conceal himself, up among the branches of
a tree, perhaps, so as to have the whole party guessing,
and running around like a pack of dogs off the scent.</p>

<p>Now the last vague hope in this particular seemed shattered
by Elmer's thrilling suggestion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>And more than Red's horrified eyes roved in the direction
of the ugly black pool, across the surface of which the
foamy white bubbles kept circling constantly, as the surplus
water ran over the dam.</p>

<p>"Where will the rest of us look, Elmer?" asked Matty,
breaking the awful silence that had gripped them after
hearing the scout master's suggestion.</p>

<p>"Any old place," replied Elmer; "only I guess you
needn't go far along that farther shore, because Toby and
Ty were there where you see that big oak tree."</p>

<p>"They couldn't see the dam from there, could they?"
asked Red, quickly.</p>

<p>"No, that's true," answered Toby.</p>

<p>"And so they wouldn't know whether anybody knocked
poor Nat over here; or if he went across to the old mill,"
Red continued.</p>

<p>"Right you are, Red," replied Ty; "but neither did we
hear any shout. An old bluejay was screechin' in the woods
near us. Yep, a feller might 'a' called out and we not noticed
it."</p>

<p>"I want two of you to go with me to the mill," said
Elmer.</p>

<p>"Count me for one!" cried some one, instantly; and
of course that was the eager Chatz, who would have started
a new rebellion had he been debarred that privilege.</p>

<p>"And I'm the second victim," declared Lil Artha, with
a grin, but at the same time looking very determined.</p>

<p>"All right," said Elmer; "fall in behind me, and we'll
see what the inside of the mill looks like."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>THE SEARCH FOR A CLEW.</h3>


<p>Following the lead of Elmer, the tall lanky scout and
the wiry Southern boy quickly found themselves at the
other end of the mill dam.</p>

<p>Lil Artha had cast his eyes about him as he cautiously
made his way along. He seemed to be figuring on what
chance there might be for an active chap like Nat Scott
slipping on one of the wet and moss-covered stones, to go
tumbling down toward that suspicious black pool.</p>

<p>Not so Chatz Maxfield.</p>

<p>Apparently he had made up his mind from the start
that this strange vanishing of their comrade must have
some connection with the mystery of the old mill.</p>

<p>Did they not admit that three separate times people had
tried to live there in the dwelling that was part and parcel
of the mill; and on every occasion they had given it up
as a bad job?</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Well, it seemed to be understood that none of them could
stand the sights and sounds which had come to them while
under that roof.</p>

<p>People might scoff at such things all they had a mind to,
but surely it seemed as if there must be <i>something</i> in it.</p>

<p>At any rate, everyone of those three families believed
the mill house haunted. And for many years now, no one
had had the nerve to occupy the place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>And yet it had once been a paying venture, for the main
road was only a few hundred yards away from this lonely,
forbidding-looking pond, where the frogs grew so large
and the red-marked "turkles," as Ty Collins called them,
were so saucy.</p>

<p>"Careful here!" warned Elmer, as they arrived at
the runway, where in times past the water was turned on
when the mill was to be operated.</p>

<p>The boards were rotting and slimy, and if one made a
slip he might get a wet jacket in the sluice, where there
was more or less running water.</p>

<p>Elmer held up a hand to hold his comrades back. He
seemed to be down on his hands and knees, as though examining
something that had just caught his attention.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"He came this way, all right, boys."</p>

<p>"Do you mean Nat?" questioned Chatz.</p>

<p>"Why, of course," replied the leader.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" continued Chatz.</p>

<p>"I've been following Nat's trail for miles," answered
Elmer, "and sure I ought to know what his footprint
looks like. Here it is on this clay just beside the sluice.
Wait till I cross and see if he made the other side all
right."</p>

<p>"He must, because he ain't in the sluiceway," remarked
the tall boy.</p>

<p>A minute later and Elmer, who had carefully crossed
over, testing each board before trusting his weight on it,
called out:</p>

<p>"The marks are here, all right, fellows. Nat did start
to look into the old mill. Come over, but be careful. Go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
slow, Chatz," he warned again, as the impetuous Southern
boy slipped, and might have landed in the slimy sluice
only that Lil Artha threw out a hand and clutched him.</p>

<p>They were now almost in the shadow of the deserted
mill. It looked gloomy and forbidding to the eyes of at
least Elmer and the tall lad, though Chatz may have considered
it an object well worth coming a long distance to
see.</p>

<p>"Wow! I must get some pictures of this same old ruin
while we're up here," said Lil Artha, who carried a little
pocket camera along, and was a very clever artist indeed.</p>

<p>"A fine idea," remarked Elmer; "but there are a lot
of good people in Hickory Ridge who would think a picture
of Munsey's mill very tame and incomplete without the
ghost showing in it."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Chatz, his face aglow.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," Lil Artha went on, "perhaps now I might
be lucky enough to tempt that same ghost to pose for me.
Anyhow I mean to ask him, if so be we happen to run across
his trail."</p>

<p>He looked at Chatz, and then winked one eye humorously
at Elmer. But the Southern boy did not deign to take any
notice.</p>

<p>"Come, let's go in, fellows," he said, impatiently.</p>

<p>With that the three started for the other side of the mill,
where an entrance could most likely be much more easily
effected.</p>

<p>Elmer continued to watch the ground, and from the satisfied
look on his face Lil Artha felt sure the scout master
must be discovering further traces of the missing boy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps, after all, they would find Nat hiding inside the
mill or the dwelling alongside. Perhaps he had been so
busy investigating that he had not noticed their shouts,
or the bugle call, for the falling water made quite a little
noise.</p>

<p>Or, on the other hand, possibly Nat may have been seized
with a sudden desire to tease his comrades in return for
many a practical joke of which he had been the victim.</p>

<p>But one of the three was quite firm in his belief that
neither of these explanations would turn out to be the true
one.</p>

<p>Of course this was Chatz Maxfield, through whose mind
had run the conviction that poor Nat Scott must have paid
dearly for his temerity in invading the haunted mill.</p>

<p>Yes, Chatz feared that the ghost must have got Nat,
though he was afraid to openly proclaim his belief. Fear
of ridicule was a weakness of Chatz. It often causes boys
to hide their real feelings, and even appear to be much
bolder than they naturally are.</p>

<p>Once around the end of the mill and they saw the dwelling
attached to it.</p>

<p>Here, too, was the old road, now overgrown with weeds
and almost hidden from view. And yet, twenty years ago,
in Miller Munsey's time, no doubt farmers daily drove
up here with sacks of corn, wheat, or rye, to have the grain
delivered to them again in the shape of flour.</p>

<p>"Shall we try to go in by way of the house door?"
asked Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"No," replied Elmer, "he went in through that opening
where some boards are off the side of the mill. Perhaps
we'd better do the same."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"A good idea," remarked Chatz, with the air of one
who could not get inside the walls of the mill too speedily
to please him.</p>

<p>"Just as you say, Elmer," the lanky scout observed;
for having been in the company of the other when the latter
was acting as pathfinder to the expedition, Lil Artha
was more than ever filled with admiration for his wonderful
talents in discovering things supposed to be lost.</p>

<p>So Elmer without further hesitation ducked through
the opening, with his two allies keeping close to his heels.</p>

<p>At any rate it was somewhat more restful inside the mill.</p>

<p>Those walls, even if now going rapidly into a condition
of decay, shut out some of the noise caused by the falling
water.</p>

<p>Lil Artha and Chatz both looked about them eagerly,
even anxiously, as soon as they found themselves within
those walls which had once resounded to the clatter of the
grinding.</p>

<p>Their motives, however, were probably as far apart as
the two poles; while the long-legged scout hoped, yet
dreaded, to see the figure of Nat Scott lying somewhere
about, Chatz, on the other hand, was anticipating discovering
some token of ghostly visitors.</p>

<p>Nothing rewarded either of them, however. The interior
of the mill was of course in a generally dilapidated condition.
What remnants of the crushing and milling machinery
remained were rusty and broken, as though tramps
may have made the place a refuge, and tried to destroy
what they could not carry away to sell.</p>

<p>The boards creaked dismally under their tread. More<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
than that, they were loose in places, and Lil Artha, stepping
upon the end of one, might have vanished through a gap
in the floor only that his agility saved him.</p>

<p>"Wow, would you see that, now, Elmer!" he exclaimed,
his voice sounding strange amidst such singular surroundings.</p>

<p>"You made a neat side step, old fellow," said the one
addressed. "Some of us, more clumsy, would have slid
down into the cellar."</p>

<p>"Say, now, I wonder&mdash;" began Lil Artha, and then
stopped to stare at the treacherous plank that formed such
a trap.</p>

<p>"You're wondering whether poor old Nat could have
taken that tumble?" suggested Elmer.</p>

<p>"That's what I was; what do you think?" asked the tall
scout.</p>

<p>"Here, lay hold and we'll soon find out," remarked
Elmer, bending over the loose plank.</p>

<p>It required considerable tugging to get it out of the bed
it had occupied so long, even if it was fastened by no
nails.</p>

<p>Both of them lay down and thrust their faces into the
gap.</p>

<p>"Looks pretty dark down there, don't it?" asked Lil
Artha, who was secretly shivering with the anticipation of
making a grewsome discovery, but who would not have his
comrades know the true condition of his nerves for a good
deal.</p>

<p>"It sure does that," was Elmer's reply.</p>

<p>"I can just make out something or other lying down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
there; it might be an old log, you know, and again, p'raps it
ain't."</p>

<p>Lil Artha did not venture to say plainly that he more
than half feared lest the object he could see might turn out
to be poor Nat Scott. But that was a fact.</p>

<p>"Well, let's find out for sure."</p>

<p>Elmer, while speaking, was taking something from his
pocket. It proved to be an old newspaper, from which
he tore a sheet, crumpling it up into a ball.</p>

<p>"I generally carry a newspaper along when I go into
the woods," he said in explanation. "And it's wonderful
what a help it sometimes turns out to be in case you want
to start a quick fire. Now for a match."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry now," remarked Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"About what?" asked the scout leader.</p>

<p>"That I didn't think to fetch it along&mdash;that new electric
hand torch my father gave me on my birthday, you
remember, Elmer?"</p>

<p>"Oh," laughed Elmer, "well, who'd ever think we'd
have any need of a torch on this hike! Why, it was an
altogether daylight affair, and we expected to be back
home long before supper time. I even promised Mark to
practice battery work some this afternoon. There, now
watch when it drops. I hope there's nothing down there
to take fire."</p>

<p>"If the old trap did go up in smoke I guess nobody
would care much," muttered Lil Artha, as he pressed his
face still further into the opening, after Elmer released
his fire ball.</p>

<p>The burning paper seemed to alight upon the damp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
earthen floor of the cellar. Immediately both boys tried to
secure a mental photograph of all there was below them.</p>

<p>"It's only a log!" cried Lil Artha, in a relieved tone
of voice, and at the same time betraying more or less disappointment,
for perhaps he had made up his mind that
they were to be treated to some species of horror.</p>

<p>"You're right," added Elmer, "that's what it is&mdash;an
old log that has lain there, goodness only knows how long.
Nat doesn't seem to have slipped down into the cellar, then,
does he?"</p>

<p>"Not that you could notice," replied Lil Artha, and then
he added: "but Elmer, didn't you notice something jump
when that paper first went down?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, I did, for a fact, Arthur."</p>

<p>"Any idea what it could be?" persisted the other.</p>

<p>"I hope you're not thinking of that ghost we've heard
so much about?" said Elmer.</p>

<p>"Now, that's hardly fair, Elmer; you know I don't take
any stock in fairy tales or hobgoblin yarns. But something
sure moved."</p>

<p>"A big rat I guess, perhaps a muskrat from the pond
above. They sometimes find a burrow leads them to some
old, unused cellar."</p>

<p>"But look over there, and you'll see a lot of white bones,
Elmer," pursued Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"That's a fact. Some animal must have fallen in here,
starved to death, and been eaten up by the rats."</p>

<p>"But, Elmer, are you sure they are animal bones?"</p>

<p>"I noticed the skull, and I think it must have been a
large dog," replied Elmer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he and the tall scout scrambled hastily to their
feet, for Chatz had suddenly given utterance to an exclamation
that seemed to contain much of both surprise
and mystification.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>THE TRAIL GROWS WARMER.</h3>


<p>"Say, just look up there, fellows!"</p>

<p>Chatz pointed a quivering finger upward as he gave utterance
to these words.</p>

<p>Of course both Elmer and the lengthy scout followed his
directions, and turned an inquiring gaze toward the dimly
seen rafters of the old deserted mill.</p>

<p>"Gee whittaker! what in the dickens are they?" exclaimed
Lil Artha, as his startled eyes rested on what
seemed to be countless numbers of queer little bunches of
dusky gray or brown hair.</p>

<p>They looked for all the world like some farmer's wife's
winter collection of herbs, tied up in small packages, and
fastened in regular order along the different beams.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare," laughed Elmer.</p>

<p>"You know what they are, Elmer; let us in on it, won't
you?" demanded Chatz.</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever to do with the ghost, but all the
same often found in haunted houses, church belfries, and
old towers. See here."</p>

<p>He stooped and picked up quite a good-sized stone that
happened to be lying on the floor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Elmer was a pitcher on the Hickory Ridge baseball nine,
and could hurl a pretty swift ball.</p>

<p>When he shot that stone upward it went like a young
cyclone, struck the rafters with a loud bang, clattered
around from one beam to another, and finally fell back to
the floor with a thud.</p>

<p>This latter sound was certainly not heard by any one
of the three scouts, for it was utterly drowned in a tremendous
rush as of sturdy wings, and several openings
above were filled with some rapidly flying objects.</p>

<p>"Wow, did you ever see the like of that now!" cried
Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"What were they, Elmer?" asked Chatz, who had really
been too startled to think fairly.</p>

<p>"Bats!" replied the scout leader, promptly.</p>

<p>"I supposed as much," declared Chatz, "and as you
remarked just now, they always seem to like a building
said to be haunted."</p>

<p>"Well," remarked the tall boy, "sometimes I've had
the fellows hint to me that I had bats in <i>my</i> belfry; but
sure not that many. Why, I reckon there must have been
well-nigh a thousand in that gay bunch, Elmer."</p>

<p>"I guess there were, more or less," replied the other.</p>

<p>"And now what?" asked Chatz.</p>

<p>"Let's look further here before we go into the house
itself," the scout master made reply.</p>

<p>So they went from one end of the deserted mill to the
other, peering into every place where it seemed there might
be the slightest hope of discovering their missing comrade.</p>

<p>Elmer even entered a small room off the main floor, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
which had possibly been used as an office when the grist-mill
was in business.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing, Elmer?" announced Lil Artha, as the
other came out again.</p>

<p>Elmer shook his head in the negative.</p>

<p>"Don't seem to be around here at all," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, let's try the house," suggested Chatz; and it
was easily seen from his manner that he was eager to make
the change.</p>

<p>After one more careful glance around, as if to make absolutely
positive that nothing had been neglected, the scout
leader nodded his head.</p>

<p>"Come on, then, fellows," he said.</p>

<p>So the others once more fell in his wake, like true
scouts who knew their little lesson full well, and were ready
to follow their leader wherever he might choose to go.</p>

<p>Elmer had previously noticed a door leading, as he believed,
from the main mill into the cottage that had once
been the miller's home.</p>

<p>Toward this he now pushed. He wondered if he would
find the door fastened in any way. One touch told him it
was not.</p>

<p>And so, without hesitation, Elmer strode across the
threshold into what had once been the happy home of a
contented miller, until trouble came, and tragedy ended
it all.</p>

<p>Like the mill itself the house was fast falling into a state
of decay.</p>

<p>It was only a cottage of some four rooms, all on the one
floor. The boys passed from one apartment to another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
until presently they had been over all the territory comprised
within those four walls, so far as they could see.</p>

<p>Both Chatz and Lil Artha uttered exclamations that
breathed their disappointment.</p>

<p>Because each of them had failed to discover that upon
which he had set his mind he failed to see anything else.</p>

<p>Not so Elmer, who carried out the principle which he
was forever holding up before the others as a cardinal virtue
which should govern a true scout always.</p>

<p>He noted a number of things that the other two might
have passed by, simply because they refused to let their
minds work outside of a certain groove.</p>

<p>A frown came upon Elmer's face also, as though he did
not wholly like the looks of things.</p>

<p>"Well, he ain't here, that's sure," remarked Lil Artha,
shrugging his shoulders in disgust.</p>

<p>"He certainly isn't," muttered Chatz, who, however, was
thinking of an entirely different object than the one the
tall boy referred to.</p>

<p>"Suppose we give him a shout, and see if there's any
result?" suggested Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"Do so, if you like," replied Elmer, in a tone that did
not seem to promise much faith in the outcome of this plan.</p>

<p>So the tall boy raised his voice and shouted in his loudest
key. A few stray bats that had taken up lodgings in
various dark corners of the four rooms went flapping
through a broken sash. But beyond that nothing came to
pass.</p>

<p>"This sure beats the Dutch," remarked Lil Artha, using
his bandana again to wipe off the perspiration that had
gathered in beads upon his forehead.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Elmer was looking around again.</p>

<p>"Wonder if there can be a cellar under here?" he remarked,
presently.</p>

<p>"I should say yes," replied the tall boy.</p>

<p>"Then there ought to be a trapdoor in the floor somewhere
about. Look around and see if you can find it, boys,"
Elmer continued, himself stepping into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Chatz and the tall boy had hardly gotten well started
in their search than they heard Elmer calling.</p>

<p>"He's found it, sure!" observed the Southern lad.</p>

<p>"The luckiest chap ever, take that from me," declared
Lil Artha, and then adding hastily: "but then, he always
deserves his luck, because he works for it."</p>

<p>Although he did not exactly mean to do so, the one
who said that expressed one of the greatest truths known.
Deserve good luck, and it will many times knock at your
door. Do things worth while, and obtain pleasing results.</p>

<p>Of course they hastened into the kitchen. Here they
found Elmer bending over and examining the floor.</p>

<p>"It's a trapdoor, all right," declared Lil Artha, as he
noted the dimensions of the cracks that formed an almost
perfect square.</p>

<p>"But how to get it up's the question," said Elmer; "for
there seems to be no ring in sight. All the same, boys, I
reckon this same trap has been used more than a few times
lately, from the looks of things."</p>

<p>"Whew! do you really mean it, Elmer?" remarked
Chatz, deeply interested.</p>

<p>"Why, you can see for yourself right here that some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
sort of tool has been used to pry up the thing," Elmer
went on.</p>

<p>"Say, I had a glimpse of an old broken kitchen knife
lying over there by the sink. Wonder if that would do
the trick? Shall I get it?" remarked Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"If you will," replied Elmer.</p>

<p>The article in question was speedily placed in the hands
of the scout master.</p>

<p>"Just the very thing to lift this trap with," he declared,
as he started to insert the stout remnant of the blade in the
crack.</p>

<p>"Reckon it's been used to do the trick many a time,"
advanced Chatz.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't wonder," Elmer added.</p>

<p>Using the broken blade as a lever he soon pried the trap
up far enough to allow the others a chance to insert their
ready fingers. After that it was easily completed, and the
square of wooden flooring removed.</p>

<p>"Dark as Egypt," remarked Lil Artha, as he tried to
pierce the gloom with his gaze.</p>

<p>Elmer made a move, and Chatz, thinking he intended descending
the ladder that led down into the unknown
depths, caught his arm.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't do it, Elmer," he said.</p>

<p>"Do what?" asked the other.</p>

<p>"Go down there," continued Chatz. "No telling how
deep it may be or what lies there, either. If anybody must
go, send me."</p>

<p>"Well," laughed Elmer, "I like your nerve, Chatz.
You think something might hurt <i>me</i>, but you don't care<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
so much for yourself. That's like you Southern fellows,
though. But make your mind easy, my boy, because just
at present I don't think any of us need drop into this
hole."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that," declared the other; "but when you
made a move I thought you were going."</p>

<p>"Oh, I only meant to get out my newspaper again, and
make another little candle," said Elmer, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"Well, say what you will, boys," remarked Lil Artha,
who had been thrusting his head below the level of the
floor and sniffing at a great rate; "I'm glad, too, that we
don't just have to drop down this ladder. It's cold and
damp down there, and I tell you I don't like the smell."</p>

<p>"There is a queer odor comes up, now that you mention
it," admitted Elmer.</p>

<p>At that the eyes of Chatz grew round with wonder and
suspense.</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope you don't think&mdash;" he began, when Elmer
interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Kind of fishy smell, don't you think?" he said.</p>

<p>"Well, since you speak of it I rather guess it is something
like that," Lil Artha admitted.</p>

<p>Then Chatz breathed easy again.</p>

<p>"But how could fish ever get in here from the mill
pond?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Give it up; I pass. Ask me something easy," the
tall scout hastened to say.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Elmer had, as before, taken a section of
the newspaper, crumpled it into a ball, and after that
drew out his match box.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Guess it's safe to drop this down," he remarked. "It
seems so damp there can really be no danger of anything
taking fire."</p>

<p>"Sure there couldn't," asserted Lil Artha, sturdily.
"Let her go, Elmer; and everybody look."</p>

<p>The match crackled, and the resulting flame was instantly
applied to the paper ball.</p>

<p>Then Elmer let this drop, after he had made sure it
would burn.</p>

<p>Three pairs of very good eyes immediately started in to
take a complete inventory of the contents of the little
damp cellar under the deserted mill cottage.</p>

<p>For perhaps a full minute the paper ball continued to
burn, lighting up the cellar well enough for them to see
from wall to wall.</p>

<p>Then the flame dwindled, flickered, and finally went out
altogether. Chatz gave a big sigh.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"What did you see, Chatz?" asked Elmer.</p>

<p>"Who, me?" exclaimed the Southern boy. "Nothing
at all, Elmer," and his manner told plainly that he was
both disappointed and disgusted.</p>

<p>"How about you, Arthur?" continued the acting scout
master.</p>

<p>"What did I see?" Lil Artha replied, promptly; "four
damp-looking stone walls, a hard earth floor, and a few old
boxes lying around, but not another blessed thing."</p>

<p>Something about Elmer's manner caught his attention
and aroused his suspicions.</p>

<p>"See here, did <i>you</i> discover anything?" he demanded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," replied Elmer, "I can't say that the evidence
is so plain a fellow who runs may read; but from a number
of things I've seen since coming here to the Munsey mill
pond I've about made up my mind this place isn't quite
as deserted as people seem to believe."</p>

<p>"Do you mean, Elmer," cried Lil Artha, excitedly,
"that tramps or some more yeggmen, like those fellows we
met with up at McGraw's lumber camp, have squatted here
in this haunted house?"</p>

<p>"Something like that," replied the other, steadily,
"though I don't believe they dare spend a night under
this roof. There's no sign of that."</p>

<p>"But what would they kidnap our chum for?" demanded
the excited tall scout.</p>

<p>"I don't know for certain, but we're going to find out
pretty soon," said Elmer, with a determined look.</p>

<h3>HUNTING FOR THE MISSING SCOUT.</h3>


<p>"Honest, now, Elmer, do you really believe that?"
asked Chatz Maxfield, after staring at the scout master in
a puzzled manner for half a dozen seconds.</p>

<p>"It looks so, on the face of it," replied the other.</p>

<p>"But plague take it," argued Chatz, "for the life of
me I just can't understand, suh, what those fellows would
want to make a prisoner of poor Nat for. In all our troop
he's about the most harmless scout, except perhaps Jasper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Merriweather. Nat is strong as an ox, but he wouldn't
hurt a fly if he could help it."</p>

<p>"That's so," echoed Lil Artha. "I've seen him walk
around so as not to step on a harmless little snake on the
road. And it wasn't because he was afraid of snakes,
either. Remember he killed that fierce big copperhead last
summer, after the other fellows had skipped out?"</p>

<p>"There's one chance, though," Elmer went on, "that
after all Nat may be hiding."</p>

<p>"But he knows the sound of the bugle, and what penalty
follows disobedience on the part of a scout," declared
Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"That's true enough, fellows," Elmer said, as if he himself
might be trying to see through a haze; "but perhaps
Nat finds himself in a position where he can't answer us
without betraying himself to these unknown men."</p>

<p>Again did Chatz and the tall scout look at each other
helplessly. And judging from the way they shook their
heads, the puzzle was evidently too deep for them.</p>

<p>"Say, Elmer, you manage to get on to these things in
a way to beat the band; could you give a guess now about
how many men there are holding out around this old
haunted mill?"</p>

<p>Lil Artha asked this in good faith. He had come to believe,
with most of his comrades, that Elmer Chenowith
was next door to a wizard. Of course they realized that
his knowledge was at all times founded on facts and common
sense; yet this did not detract from the wonder of his
accomplishments.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think there are three at least, perhaps four or five
in the lot," Elmer replied.</p>

<p>"Whew! that's a healthy crowd of toughs, now, to run
up against!" remarked Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"And what do you propose doing, suh, if I may make
so bold as to ask?"</p>

<p>Chatz was usually a very dignified fellow, especially when
coming in contact with one who, according to recognized
scout law, must be considered his superior officer, and as
such entitled to respect.</p>

<p>"First of all, perhaps we'd better go outside," the other
replied.</p>

<p>"And tell the rest of the boys what we've found&mdash;or
rather what we didn't find," remarked Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"Yes. There doesn't seem to be anything more to poke
into here; for I'm dead certain those men, whoever they
are, don't make their headquarters in either the mill or
the cottage."</p>

<p>"You mean they don't sleep here; is that it, suh?" inquired
Chatz.</p>

<p>"That covers the ground," Elmer answered.</p>

<p>"But they <i>do</i> come in here sometimes, while the sun
is shining," persisted Chatz.</p>

<p>"I have seen the marks of many heavy hobnailed shoes
in the dust of this place; and some of the prints were
very fresh," came the answer.</p>

<p>"Then if they're wanting in the nerve to sleep under
this roof, when it would be so handy, in a thunderstorm
like we had the other day, for instance, that looks as if
they believed some in the ghost story, don't it, Elmer?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, I suppose it does, Chatz."</p>

<p>"All right. I'm not saying anything more," remarked
the Southern boy, with a look of conviction on his dark
face, "but I only hope we run across one or more of these
mysterious unknowns while we're up at Munsey's mill."</p>

<p>"Listen to that, would you, Elmer! I declare if he don't
mean to interview these fellows, and find out what they've
gone and seen here in the night time!" and Lil Artha
chuckled as he said this.</p>

<p>"All right," remarked Chatz. "There are a lot of
things I've always wanted to know, and I'd be a silly to
let the chance slip past me."</p>

<p>"Hey, how about this bally old trapdoor, Elmer?" demanded
Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"We'd better put it back where it belongs," replied
the scout leader.</p>

<p>"I reckon you're right, suh," observed Chatz. "If some
one came in here, walking in the dark, he might take a
nasty header down this hole."</p>

<p>"Say, supposing your ghost did that," remarked the
tall scout, as he helped lift the wooden square back to
where it belonged; "why, you could do better than asking
questions of an outsider, because, Chatz, you might
interview your old ghost himself."</p>

<p>The other drew himself up.</p>

<p>"Kindly omit calling it <i>my</i> ghost, if you please, suh,"
he said, stiffly. "I don't pretend to have any claim on
the object in question&mdash;if there really is such a thing. I'm
only wanting to know; and I come from South Carolina,
suh, not Missouri."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Elmer, after one last glance around the kitchen, was
heading for the other room where an exit could be made.</p>

<p>And it was almost ludicrous to see with what haste the
other two followed after; just as if neither of them cared
to be left alone inside the walls of the haunted mill cottage.</p>

<p>Once outside, they found several of their comrades clustered
near by, evidently awaiting them. That curiosity was
rapidly reaching fever heat it was easy to see from the
anxious looks cast upon those who had been investigating
the interior of the buildings.</p>

<p>No doubt every fellow had meanwhile been industriously
engaged in ransacking his brain to remember all he had
ever heard concerning Munsey's mill, and the troublesome
spirit that had frightened away three separate tenants in
years gone by.</p>

<p>They were rather a demoralized trio of boys who welcomed
the coming of Elmer, Chatz, and Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"Find any signs of Nat?" asked one.</p>

<p>"Hope the plagued old ghost didn't get him," another
ventured.</p>

<p>"Tell us all about it, Elmer?" asked the third member
of the little bunch.</p>

<p>But the scout leader instead raised the bugle to his lips
and sounded the assembly call.</p>

<p>Voices were heard, and immediately the others came
hurrying to the spot. Landy was the last to arrive, and
he came up puffing and blowing as though he might have
been at some little distance when he heard the summons
for gathering.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Listen!" said Elmer, raising his hand, and immediately
the confused chattering of many boyish tongues
ceased.</p>

<p>This enabled them to hear distant shouts from the southeast,
as though newcomers might be approaching the mill
over about the same course as that they had pursued.</p>

<p>"Mark Cummings and the last detachment!" declared
Matty.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! six more good fellows to do battle with the
outlaws of the haunted mill!" exclaimed Red; at which
some of the others gasped in astonishment, and exchanged
uneasy glances.</p>

<p>"Better wait till they all get here, boys," said Elmer,
"and then I'll tell you what we've found out, also what
we suspect."</p>

<p>Chatz and Lil Artha could not but notice how particular
Elmer was to use the plural pronoun. But then, that was
always his way. Whatever faults the boy may have had&mdash;and
the best of fellows comes far from being perfect&mdash;selfishness
was not one of them. Impatiently they waited
for the coming of the six scouts forming the last detachment.
This would increase their roll-call to sixteen, lacking
only <i>one</i> of the number that had started out.</p>

<p>Presently a sight of khaki uniforms among the trees announced
their near approach.</p>

<p>As the two wings of the Hickory Ridge Troop of Boy
Scouts came together, there was a general exchange of
badinage.</p>

<p>The newcomers had an intense desire to learn whether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
their interpretation of the messages might excel that of
the first detachment.</p>

<p>But in the midst of the questioning, the startling news
concerning Nat Scott's mysterious vanishing began to circulate
among the newcomers.</p>

<p>This put a quietus on all business, and the entire troop
clustered around Elmer, begging to know what it could
mean.</p>

<p>So the scout master, understanding just how his comrades
must feel, started in to explain, as far as lay in his power.</p>

<p>First of all, for the benefit of the newcomers, he told
of how Nat's disappearance was brought to his attention
by Toby and Ty, just before the coming of Matty and his
group of scouts.</p>

<p>Then he quickly related what he and Chatz and Lil Artha
had done in the deserted buildings close by.</p>

<p>Presently the story was finished, and some of the boys,
who had listened with hearts beating much faster than
their wont, took the first decent breath in five minutes.</p>

<p>Of course questions poured in on Elmer as thick as
hail stones during a summer storm. Finding it utterly
impossible to answer a quarter of these intelligently, and
make any kind of progress, Elmer called for silence.</p>

<p>"It stands to reason, fellows," he remarked, when the
last whisper had died away, "that we've got to have system
about this thing if we expect to do any business. Am
I right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," came from every scout; for boys though
they were, they recognized the wisdom of what he said.</p>

<p>"All right, then," Elmer went on. "I'm going to divide<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the troop into three searching parties. We must scour the
neighborhood and see if we can find any sign of where these
unknown men sleep, for there isn't any trace of their
staying in cottage or mill at night time."</p>

<p>"We understand what you mean, Elmer. How shall
we divide up?" asked Mark.</p>

<p>"You keep your detachment as it was, intact, Mark,"
came the reply; "and Matty, you have your six to back
you. Lil Artha, Toby, and Ty will fall in with me, and
make the third party."</p>

<p>"All right, suh, we understand," called out Chatz.</p>

<p>But he, as well as many others of the boys, showed in
their faces that they envied the good luck of the three
fellows who had been picked out to form Elmer's smaller
group.</p>

<p>"What are our duties to be?" asked Mark, who, having
only recently arrived, and being staggered by the sudden
nature of the intelligence, had as yet not fully grasped
the situation.</p>

<p>"First of all, let every scout who has not already done
so, pick up a stout club in the woods, as he passes along,"
said Elmer.</p>

<p>"Like this, for instance," remarked Jack Armitage,
flourishing a husky specimen that would pass muster for an
Irishman's shillalah.</p>

<p>"Or this!" cried Red, whose cudgel was as long as a
walking stick, and almost as thick through as his wrist.</p>

<p>"Suit yourselves about that, boys," continued the scout
master, "only don't be in a hurry to use them as weapons
until you have the order. Now, each detachment must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
keep close enough together so that the members may communicate
by means of patrol calls&mdash;the cry of the wolf,
the slap of a beaver's tail as he beats the water to call his
mate, or the scream of the eagle."</p>

<p>"We know, Elmer; what else?" asked Matty.</p>

<p>"All the while you will keep on the lookout for some
sign of the enemy. The scout who discovers anything
that he thinks would have a bearing on the solving of the
puzzle must immediately summon his leader. This he can
do by the whistle which all of you know, as it has been
used before."</p>

<p>"Is that all, Elmer?" asked Mark.</p>

<p>"If the matter seems very important to the mind of the
leader, let him give the assembly call very loud on his
whistle. Upon hearing that, every scout is expected to
give up hunting on his own account, and head in toward
the place the signal comes from. Is that plain to every
fellow?"</p>

<p>A chorus of assent answered him.</p>

<p>"That's all, then, fellows," Elmer went on. "Do your
duty, every scout. We've got to find our comrade, and
we've got to get him out of the hands of these men, whoever
they may turn out to be."</p>

<p>"If they've hurt our Nat, it's going to be a bad day
for them, that's all," blustered Red, as he pounded his
club against an inoffensive stone.</p>

<p>"Now, start out, fellows, and let's see who'll be the
lucky one to discover this hidden shack where these men
must stay nights," Elmer concluded.</p>

<p>"Say, hold on here! Is <i>that</i> what you're looking for&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
hidden shack? Why, I can take you to one right now,"
called out a voice.</p>

<p>The speaker was Landy Smith.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>THE AMBITION OF LANDY.</h3>


<p>Every boy became suddenly stationary when this surprising
intelligence broke from the lips of the new member,
who, like three others in the troop, did not wear a khaki
uniform.</p>

<p>Elmer had several times let his eye fall on the stout
boy, as though trying to guess what his manner indicated.</p>

<p>He had seen Landy come up last of all, panting so for
breath that not one word had he spoken while the scout
master was explaining things.</p>

<p>Landy was not only a tenderfoot scout, but he had in
a number of ways proven his right to the title of greenhorn.</p>

<p>Imagine, then, the utter amazement of his comrades
when he so coolly declared that he might be able to lead
them to a hidden shack.</p>

<p>Elmer, if surprised, did not allow this fact to interfere
with his plain duty.</p>

<p>"Come here, Landy," he said, and the stout new recruit
hastened to do as he was ordered.</p>

<p>Of course Landy would not have been human, and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
boy, had he been able to repress the grin that forced itself
upon his rosy countenance.</p>

<p>Perhaps he remembered saying not so very long ago
that the time might come when he would be able to prove
his ability to carry the name of a scout.</p>

<p>Of course at the time Landy could never have even
dreamed the opening would arrive so soon. That made
it all the more welcome. Perhaps now, some of the fellows
who loved to tease him, and say that he was too
fat and slow-witted to ever be a shining success in the
Hickory Hill troop, would change their tune.</p>

<p>Landy's hour had come. He was in the lime light, and
occupied the center of the stage.</p>

<p>Mindful of the respect due his superior officer, Landy
saluted as he clicked his heels together, and stood at attention
before the scout master.</p>

<p>"You say you can show us where there is a hidden
shack or cabin, do you, Number Eight?"</p>

<p>Elmer frequently addressed the boys by the number
they held in their patrol, and as Landy was the last one
admitted into the Wolf Patrol he went as Number Eight.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," the tenderfoot replied, quite enjoying the
fact that fifteen pairs of eager eyes were riveted upon him
right then and there.</p>

<p>Landy looked redder than usual, but for all that he
seemed able to command his voice, for it did not tremble a
particle.</p>

<p>"You arrived later than the rest when I sounded the
assembly on the bugle," went on Elmer; "was that because
you were some little distance away?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I was just going to peek in through the
window of that funny little cabin I found when I heard
the call. But I didn't look, sir, because I knew <i>a scout's
duty was to obey</i>!"</p>

<p>"Hear, hear!" said Red, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"That was well done, Number Eight," Elmer continued,
"and I hope you will always keep your duty before your
mind. Do you think you could lead us to where you saw
that hidden shack?"</p>

<p>"I expect I can, sir; anyhow, I'm ready to try," Landy
promptly answered.</p>

<p>Several of the scouts exchanged nods and glances. Why,
they had never before dreamed that the fat boy had so
much business about him. He acted just as might one
who had been a member of the troop a whole month, instead
of but a few days.</p>

<p>It was plain to be seen that his becoming a scout was
going to be the making of Philander Smith. Already
there was a great change in his ways. He was throwing
off his weaknesses, and beginning to think for himself.</p>

<p>"All right," said Elmer; "suppose you come with me,
then, Number Eight, and try to go back over your own
trail. That might be the quickest way to get there."</p>

<p>"But how about us, Mr. Scout Master; do we keep up
the formation as arranged?" asked Mark.</p>

<p>"No, for the present that is all off," Elmer replied,
"the whole of you fall in behind; and don't forget to
keep an eye out for your sticks. But no talking above a
whisper, remember. This may turn out to be serious business.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>"</p>

<p>The scouts already realized this. Still his words of
caution entailing silence were well placed, for boys as a
rule do love to chatter.</p>

<p>And so the whole troop started off, with Elmer and Landy
in the lead, the latter hardly knowing whether to be tickled
at the attention he was receiving, or worried because he
presently began to doubt his ability to "deliver the goods."</p>

<p>Strange how all sections of the woods look alike to
a fellow who is a novice in the art of picking his way.
Landy had imagined that he was just soaking in valuable
information while following the lead of Matty or Elmer.
But when the crisis arose, and he found himself placed
upon his own responsibility, he lost confidence.</p>

<p>Pretty soon Elmer guessed the truth, and that their
guide was getting what Lil Artha would call "wabbly."
This was when he took them twice to the same spot and then
looked pained.</p>

<p>"Up a stump, fellows," chuckled Larry, who had perhaps
himself felt a little twinge of jealousy because a greenhorn
had so suddenly leaped into the front when older and
more experienced scouts had been unable to score.</p>

<p>But Elmer was not at all dismayed. In fact, to tell the
actual truth, he had rather expected that the new beginner
might find more or less trouble in carrying out his orders.</p>

<p>"Getting mixed up some, are you, Number Eight?"
he demanded, as Landy scratched his head and then tenderly
caressed quite a good-sized lump they now saw he
had on his forehead.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sorry to say, sir, I seem to be a little confused,"
admitted the fat boy; "but then perhaps that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
ain't to be wondered at if you knew just how hard I
bumped into that crooked tree yonder."</p>

<p>"With your head?" asked Elmer.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Landy; "you see I was trying to
hurry, when my foot caught in a vine and I went ker-slam
right against that tree. Say, but I saw ten million stars
right then! and that's no exaggeration, sir."</p>

<p>"Why do you say it was this tree, Number Eight?"
the young disciple of woodcraft continued.</p>

<p>"Well, it was impressed pretty forcibly on my head,
and my mind, too, sir," grinned Landy, "and perhaps, if
you looked, you could find the dent I bet I made when I
struck."</p>

<p>Some of the boys snickered at this. Not so Elmer, who
seemed to feel he had quite a serious proposition on his
hands, and that the others had a right to look to him to
untangle the knot.</p>

<p>"I'll soon find out," he said, and then turning to the
crowd he added: "keep back and give me a chance to
see if Landy is right."</p>

<p>"He's after the trail, that's what," said one of the
scouts, as they saw Elmer advance to where the crooked tree
pointed out by the fat recruit stood, and bend down at
its base.</p>

<p>Every eye remained glued on the young scout master.
Not a word more was said, for they knew that explanation
of Elmer's movements must be the right one.</p>

<p>No sooner had Elmer dropped to his knees than he felt
a thrill of pleasure.</p>

<p>"It's here, sure enough!" he muttered, as his eye discovered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the torn turf where Landy's toes must have dragged
when he fell.</p>

<p>And with the knowledge of trailing which he possessed,
it must surely prove an easy task to follow those plain
tracks. Landy knew nothing at all concerning the art of
hiding a trail, and which the bearer of the wampum belt
and his companion had tried their best to put into practice
with the idea of deceiving the pathfinder who came
behind.</p>

<p>When Landy put his foot down it was with considerable
emphasis. Consequently, any one of the more experienced
scouts would have been equal to the task of following that
trail backward.</p>

<p>As Elmer moved away he made a swift, beckoning movement
with his arm. This the boys interpreted as a command
or invitation to "get a move on," as Lil Artha put
it, and follow after their leader.</p>

<p>So the troop moved onward, and more than one fellow's
teeth came together with a click as he grasped his cudgel
tighter in his hand, and resolved to give a good account
of himself should it become necessary to do something
violent.</p>

<p>True, the rules counseled peaceful victories; but there
may be times when it becomes absolutely necessary for
Boy Scouts to show that they have good red blood in their
veins.</p>

<p>And most of those present were of the opinion that the
present occasion promised to be just such a crisis that called
for strenuous treatment.</p>

<p>Their companion, Nat Scott, had mysteriously disappeared,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and they had good reason to believe that he had
fallen into the hands of these unknown men who made the
vicinity of Munsey's mill their secret headquarters.</p>

<p>Why they should seize upon Nat, and what object they
could have in holding him a prisoner, were questions no
one could answer, as yet. But they meant to know, and
that before long.</p>

<p>Now and then some fellow would step aside without a
word, and possess himself of some attractive club that had
caught his eye while passing.</p>

<p>Evidently none of them had forgotten the injunction of
their leader to arm themselves. And really it was strange
how much comfort even a stout walking stick could give
a fellow on an occasion of this sort, when unseen and unknown
perils hovered about them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Elmer stuck to his task. Indeed, it was an
easy one for so experienced a tracker and pathfinder, and
he did not hurry along faster simply because he wanted a
little time to collect his own thoughts, and decide what
ought to be done.</p>

<p>When Landy so obediently gave up his investigation,
and sought to rejoin the balance of the troop when the
bugle sounded, he managed to make what proved to be a
"bee line" through the woods. Even trees that were in
the way could not stop him with impunity, as he had
proven when he collided with that crooked one.</p>

<p>This made Elmer's job still easier. And as he advanced
farther into the woods he marveled first at the rashness
of Landy in wandering so far away; and second at the
ability he displayed in getting safely back to the shore of
the pond.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Elmer was keeping one eye out ahead as he moved along.
Of course he anticipated coming upon the concealed shack
at any moment now. When he saw an unusually large
cluster of high bushes and undergrowth he felt positive
that he must be almost in touch with the place.</p>

<p>What kind of reception might they expect? If these
men, whom none of them had as yet even seen, turned out
to be rascals who were hiding from justice, and who
suspected them of being a posse sent out to round up the
tramp thieves, their manner of greeting might prove to be
anything but friendly.</p>

<p>Could they have one or more fierce dogs among them?
Elmer had not seen the first trace of a dog anywhere
around, but this could hardly be accepted as positive evidence
that there were none.</p>

<p>Frequently such men make it a point to possess canine
companions. And these are invariably of some species fond
of the spirit of battle.</p>

<p>It was partly the expectation of running across such
four-footed enemies that had influenced Elmer to have
the boys arm themselves with clubs. He knew what a
power for good a stout cudgel may prove under such conditions.</p>

<p>Looking closely he had to confess that he could see no
sign of life about that clump of bushes.</p>

<p>And yet the trail led directly from it; and as if to sweep
away his last remaining doubt he now discovered a second
series of fresh tracks leading straight <i>toward</i> the spot.</p>

<p>Besides, here was a regular path, beaten down by many
feet, and which headed in the quarter Elmer knew the big
pond lay.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>That settled it.</p>

<p>Elmer waited for the balance of the troop to come up.
Everyone's gaze was fastened on him. Eyes flashed more
brightly than usual, and some of the boys naturally showed
their nervousness by the way they kept their cudgels
moving.</p>

<p>"Is that the place, Landy, where you saw the shack?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>Landy had known it was for more than a full minute
past, but he remembered that a scout on duty must wait
to be asked before volunteering any information.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he replied, "that is the place."</p>

<p>"Spread out a little, fellows," said Elmer, quietly, "and
advance slowly. Everyone be ready to give a good account
of himself if they rush any dogs on us. Forward now!"</p>

<p>And silently the sixteen scouts, spread out somewhat like
an open fan, started to advance upon the strange dense
thicket in which Landy had seen a shack.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>READING THE SIGNS.</h3>


<p>"Halt!"</p>

<p>At the command the scouts came to a stop. They had
been gradually concentrating as they pushed forward, so
that when this halt was made they formed half a circle,
and each fellow was almost touching elbows with the next
in line.</p>

<p>Just before them, even though pretty well concealed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the foliage of the bushes, they could make out what appeared
to be a rough shack.</p>

<p>No other name would apply, for it was clumsily built out
of odds and ends of boards, secured at the mill, no doubt,
together with sods, a heap of stones, some mud that had
hardened until it resembled mortar; and, finally, a roof
thatched with straw, much after the style the boys had
seen in pictures of foreign cottages in Switzerland, France,
and Italy.</p>

<p>"Say," observed Red, who found it unusually hard to
keep from expressing his views, "I don't believe there are
any kiyi dogs around here, fellows."</p>

<p>"Don't seem like it," remarked another, doubtless
breathing a sigh of relief at the improved prospect.</p>

<p>"Sure we'd have heard them give tongue," observed
Toby, advancing boldly to look in through the opening at
the side of the shack, and which doubtless served the purpose
of a window.</p>

<p>"Careful, Toby; go slow," called out Elmer; for there
could be no telling what sort of a storm the appearance
of the boys in khaki might raise within the shanty.</p>

<p>An intense silence followed. Every fellow could feel
his heart pounding against his ribs like a trip hammer, and
he wondered whether the sound were loud enough to betray
his nervous frame of mind to his companions, never
dreaming that they were all in the same box.</p>

<p>A red squirrel in a tree overhead, that had been observing
all these doings with round-eyed wonder, began to
chatter and scold. A little striped chipmunk sat up on a
neighboring stump and took note.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nobody home, fellers," called out Toby, after he had
apparently stared in through that opening for more than
a full minute.</p>

<p>Some of the scouts looked relieved; others frowned as
if disgusted. This sort of thing might be all very well,
but it did not seem to be taking them any closer to the
rescue of their comrade, or clearing up any of the dark
fog of mystery that hung like a wet blanket between themselves
and the solution.</p>

<p>Elmer immediately strode forward. By following the
well-defined path he was able to find himself at what was
plainly the rude door of the shack.</p>

<p>Upon this he knocked sharply. There came no answer,
and even the keenest ears among the scouts failed to catch
the slightest sound following this summons.</p>

<p>"Try it once more, Elmer," advised cautious Mark.</p>

<p>Again the tattoo sounded, but as before it produced
no results. So Elmer opened the door, which he saw had
been fashioned in the rudest way from boards, and hung
upon strap hinges.</p>

<p>As he pushed the door aside, every scout held his breath
and gripped his stick expectantly. But nothing happened.
No string of rough men came bustling forth, demanding
in coarse language what the boys meant by bothering them.</p>

<p>It looked as though Toby must have struck the right
key when he so confidently declared there was nobody
at home.</p>

<p>So Elmer entered, with some of the bolder among the
scouts at his heels. The balance contented themselves in
pressing around the door and window, and taking it out
in looking.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as he had expected, Elmer found the interior of the
shack pretty gloomy. Under the best of conditions very
little daylight could find a way through such small openings,
and these were now almost filled by the bodies of
the curious scouts. But this was a matter easily remedied.
Elmer had his matchsafe ready in his hands, and his first
act was to strike a light.</p>

<p>As soon as the match flamed up he cast one quick look
around the interior. This assured him that there were certainly
no low-browed men crouching in the corners, and
ready to hurl themselves upon the young invaders.</p>

<p>The next thing Elmer did was also a very natural move.
He saw a candle in a bottle, standing on an upturned box,
and stepping forward he applied his match to the waiting
wick.</p>

<p>Then he looked around again.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt about this shack having been
recently used as sleeping quarters by a number of men.</p>

<p>Several heaps of straw told where they lay, and Elmer
counted four of these. Then there were a few bits of old
clothing hanging from nails, a pair of heavy shoes, a frying
pan, a kettle in which coffee might have been made, some
broken bread, part of a ham, and some ears of corn; this
last possibly stolen from the field of some farmer.</p>

<p>It looked like a tramp's paradise, but the puzzle was,
what would tramps be doing so far away from all customary
sources of supply?</p>

<p>Elmer sniffed the atmosphere, which was both heavy and
far from pleasant. And Lil Artha, who had pressed into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the shack, hot upon the heels of his chief, took note of his
significant action.</p>

<p>"I should say yes, it's rank as all get out," he remarked,
holding his nose between a finger and thumb. "Even
beats that fishy smell we struck when we looked down into
the cellar at the cottage. Whew!"</p>

<p>Others expressed themselves about as strongly, and little
Jasper Merriweather, who had unwisely pushed into the
shack, found it necessary to hurry out again, white of face
and gasping.</p>

<p>But Elmer had conceived an idea, even while suffering
from the unpleasant odor of the place.</p>

<p>"Howling cats!" exclaimed Lil Artha, "I don't see
how you can stand it, Elmer. Talk to me about tramps,
and the way they hate water, here's the rank evidence of
it. Wow, ain't I sorry for poor Nat if he's got to associate
with this hobo crowd for long!"</p>

<p>"But how do we know they're hoboes?" asked Elmer,
turning on the tall scout.</p>

<p>"Hey? What's that?" exclaimed Lil Artha, actually
so surprised that he neglected to hold that firm grip on
his nose any longer.</p>

<p>"What makes you so sure they're tramps?" pursued the
scout master.</p>

<p>"Why, goodness gracious alive, Elmer, you don't mean
to say you doubt that now?" cried the tall boy, sweeping
his hand around as though to draw attention to the various
articles that seemed to stamp that theory a positive fact.</p>

<p>"Seeing these things here is what makes me question
that idea very much," began Elmer; and then he picked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
up one of the old shoes, to hold it at arm's length. "Look
at that, fellows; never made in this country, and you know
it. Hobnails such as no one but foreigners use on their
shoes."</p>

<p>"Well, I declare; I guess Elmer's right!" exclaimed Red.</p>

<p>"He certainly is, suh, take my word foh it," was the
way Chatz expressed himself.</p>

<p>"Now look here, whoever saw a tramp's nest with anything
like this in it?" and Elmer picked up a string of
beads, evidently a rosary, that must have been overlooked
in a hasty flight.</p>

<p>"Whew, that's going some!" ejaculated Phil Dale who,
with his cousin Landy, happened to be in the shack eager
to see all that went on.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he can even tell us what brand of foreigners
these fellows are," remarked Landy, who was beginning
to look upon Elmer pretty much in the light of a wizard.</p>

<p>"Oh, that ought to be easy, fellows," said the young
scout master, as he reached up and took down a worn letter
his quick eye had noticed stuck in a crack.</p>

<p>Every eye was immediately focused on the scout master.
They knew his reasoning powers of old, and expected that
Elmer would quickly put them on the right track now.</p>

<p>Indeed, hardly had the latter glanced at the well-worn
letter he held than he smiled.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Red, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Yes, tell us what you've found out, Elmer," said Lil
Artha.</p>

<p>"Why, look here at the name. As near as I can make
out it's Giuseppi Caroni," replied the other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wow, that is plain enough!" exclaimed Red.</p>

<p>"Sure Italiano," echoed the tall scout.</p>

<p>"Just as I thought," replied Elmer.</p>

<p>"But you can prove it," remarked Chatz.</p>

<p>"That's easy enough," added Dr. Ted, "the thtamp
ought to be enough, you thee."</p>

<p>"And if it isn't, fellows, here's the postmark as plain
as anything&mdash;Naples, Italy," continued Elmer.</p>

<p>"Naples, hey?" remarked Lil Artha. "Say, I was just
reading about Naples the other day, and it said that next
to the island of Sicily we get more of our Black Hand
crowd from there than any other part of Garibaldi's old
land."</p>

<p>A gasp seemed to go the complete rounds of all the
khaki-clad warriors who thronged that mysterious little
shack.</p>

<p>"Black Hand, you say, Lil Artha?" exclaimed Red.</p>

<p>"Yes, and anarchists, too; the kind that blow up the
kings and queens of the Old World. The kind that abduct
people so as to make their rich relatives whack up a big
ransom."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>Some of the boys looked a little timid, and glanced around
apprehensively, as though they anticipated seeing a whole
bunch of fierce-looking dynamite users rise up around them.</p>

<p>Others shut their teeth together harder than ever, and
these more determined fellows, it might be noticed, tightened
the grip they had upon their sticks.</p>

<p>All eyes were turned again upon Elmer, who had listened
to these remarks with an amused smile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hold on your horses, boys," he said, raising his hand
just then to still the rising dispute.</p>

<p>"Shut up, everybody; Elmer's got something more to
tell us," Lil Artha cried.</p>

<p>The hubbub died away, and an eagerness to listen took
its place; for every one of them was anxious to pick up
points concerning the clever way their leader figured things
out.</p>

<p>It was an important part of a scout's duty to learn
how to read signs, not only when following a trail, but at
all times.</p>

<p>And especially valuable would this qualification become
when confronted by a baffling mystery such as the Hickory
Ridge troop was now up against.</p>

<p>"Those who occupied this shack were four in number,"
Elmer began.</p>

<p>"How did you find that out?" asked Red.</p>

<p>"By the various tracks. So far as I could see there
were just four separate kinds leading up to this place,
and each one different."</p>

<p>"Hurrah! I tell you, fellows, that's the way to learn
things. Elmer knows how to do it," cried Lil Artha.</p>

<p>Without even smiling at the implied compliment Elmer
went on:</p>

<p>"Two of them wore shoes with hobnails just as you see
on this old cast-off shoe here. A third one had on American-made
brogans, and I expect they hurt him some, too, because
he was limping as he walked. He is undoubtedly
the chap who used to own these old foreign-made gun-boats."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hold on a minute, please, Elmer," pleaded Red.</p>

<p>"All right. You want to ask me something, and I
think I know what it is," remarked the other.</p>

<p>"You say this fellow's new shoes hurt him, and made
him limp; please tell us how in the wide world you ever
found that out?" Red continued.</p>

<p>"Well, it might be possible that the fellow was always
lame, but his tracks show plainly that he limped. Something
was wrong with his left leg or foot, because the
toe dug deeply into the ground."</p>

<p>"Well, I declare is that dead-sure evidence, Elmer?"
demanded the astounded tenderfoot, Landy, who was listening
with all his might to these intensely interesting
facts as brought out by the scout master.</p>

<p>"Try it yourself sometime, Landy," remarked Elmer.
"Pick out a nice piece of ground where the marks will
show plainly. Limp as naturally as you can with the left
leg. Then go back and examine the trail. You will find
that not only does the left foot dig deeper at the toe than
the right one, but that same toe drags a little over the
ground as you bring the left foot forward each time."</p>

<p>"Just listen to that, will you!" remarked Red, "but
I know Elmer is right. I can grab the principle of the
thing."</p>

<p>"But how about the fourth one, Elmer; seems to me
you've been holding back something there, that you mean to
spring on us," said Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"Well, I have," remarked the other, quickly. "This
fourth track was smaller than the others, and the person
also wore American-made shoes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, a boy, eh?" asked Red.</p>

<p>The scout master shook his head.</p>

<p>"Wrong that time, my boy. You'll have to guess again,
I reckon," he said.</p>

<p>"Was it a woman, Elmer?" demanded Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"Just what it was&mdash;an Italian woman, squatty like most
of her race; and I should say between fifty-five and sixty
years of age," Elmer replied, soberly.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>SETTING A TRAP.</h3>


<p>At that there arose new exclamations of wonder, as well
as of disbelief.</p>

<p>"Oh, come off, now," remarked Red, quite forgetting in
his amazement the respect supposed to be shown for an
acting scout master, even though in the private walks of
life he might only be a fellow playmate; "you can't expect
us to swallow that, now, Elmer."</p>

<p>"Do you mean about the woman's height, or her age?"
asked the other, calmly.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;er&mdash;both I guess," faltered Red, weakening as
he saw the positive front of the other.</p>

<p>"Stop and think, did you ever see any other than a
short, squatty woman among the Italian laborers? And
I reckon nobody else ever did. They carry heavy burdens
on their heads, and people say that's one reason they're
always dumpy," Elmer began.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's right, fellows," broke out Landy; "why, I've
seen a dago woman carrying a mattress, a stove and some
chairs on her head all at the same time. Gee, looked like
a two-legged moving van:"</p>

<p>"But see here, you notice a shelf with a few things on
it, some hairpins among the lot. It was built unusually
low, so <i>she</i> could reach it. And what's this you see here,
fellows? A piece of broken looking glass fastened to the
wall. Notice how low down it is? No man ever used that
glass, you can depend on it; and the woman who did was
surely small, wasn't she now?"</p>

<p>"A regular sawed-off," assented Lil Artha, emphatically.</p>

<p>"Elmer's sure proved his point there, fellows," declared
Red Huggins, grinning.</p>

<p>"But what makes you think the woman is old, Elmer?"
asked Landy, curiously.</p>

<p>"That's so; how in the wide world could you know such
a thing without ever seeing her?" demanded Toby.</p>

<p>"Nothing could be easier, fellows; see here!"</p>

<p>As Elmer spoke he reached out his hand and took something
off the low shelf.</p>

<p>Those in the room crowded around, fairly wild to follow
out the clever deduction of their young leader.</p>

<p>"Why, it's a comb," cried one.</p>

<p>"Only an old broken comb," echoed another, with a
shade of uncertainty in his voice.</p>

<p>"What is there about that to tell you, Elmer?" queried
Red, staring first at the article in question, and then at
the smiling scout master.</p>

<p>"I know," burst out Matty just then.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell us," pleaded several.</p>

<p>"Yes, throw some light on the dark mystery," added
Lil Artha, "because to the untrained eye it's all as gloomy
as the inside of my pocket. A comb, and how to tell a
woman's age from that! Well, I own up beat."</p>

<p>"Why, it's as easy as falling off a log, or coming down
in a smash when you're first learning how to fly," Matty
began.</p>

<p>"Hey, don't you drag me into this thing," spoke up
Toby, whose many experiments as a new beginner in the
science of aviation had usually ended in his enjoying a
disastrous tumble.</p>

<p>"All you have to do is to examine the comb," Matty
went on. "Then you'll find that it holds a few long hairs,
and, fellows, just see how gray they are, will you?"</p>

<p>"Well, what d'ye think of that!" burst out Red. "And
I guess we're a lot of chumps, fellows, not to have seen
through it before."</p>

<p>"Would a woman be among anarchists, Elmer?" demanded
Toby.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," came the reply. "Perhaps so,
though not as a usual thing. But understand that I haven't
said I agreed with you altogether, when you gave such a
hard name to these people."</p>

<p>"Then you don't count 'em as Black Hand kidnapers,
who expect to raise a bully good sum by holding our pard,
Nat Scott, for ransom?" demanded Red.</p>

<p>"I've seen nothing to tell me that's the way matters
stand," Elmer commenced saying, "and several things seem
to say just the opposite. The presence of the woman, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
her having such an article as this precious string of beads
don't seem to go along with such a thing as a band of
rascals."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, go on, Elmer," several called out.</p>

<p>"We haven't found the slightest sign of a bomb factory
here, or even a book teaching how to bring about a
revolution. These things make me believe that these three
men and a woman may not be such terribly hard cases
after all."</p>

<p>"But you believe they've got our chum, and are holding
him a prisoner, don't you, Elmer?" asked Matty.</p>

<p>"I do believe it," Elmer went on. "In fact I know it,
because if you look back of that empty box yonder, which
they use for a table, you'll find a hat&mdash;Nat's hat, if I'm
not mistaken."</p>

<p>A rush was made for the box in question, and there followed
a confusion of tongues, as half a dozen fellows tried
to talk at once.</p>

<p>"You found a hat, didn't you?" demanded Elmer.</p>

<p>"We sure did, and here she is," cried Red, holding up
the article in question.</p>

<p>"It looks like a scout's regulation hat?" Elmer remarked.</p>

<p>"Which nobody could deny," sang Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"And as every scout present has his own hat on his
head right now, it stands to reason this couldn't belong to
any of us, eh, fellows?"</p>

<p>"To clinch the matter, Elmer," observed Matty, "if
you look inside the hat you'll find two little silver letters
fastened there. The N. S. stands for Nathaniel Scott."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, that point seems proved. Nat was here. Perhaps
in wandering about he struck this place. But the
indications are he was captured first, and brought to this
shack."</p>

<p>"But," said hasty Red, interrupting Elmer, "if you
admit that these Italians have made our pard a prisoner,
how can you say they are not bad men, thieves wanted by
the officers of the law, even if not anarchists?"</p>

<p>"Some things I can only guess at, without being able
to explain my conviction. But, honestly, fellows, I hardly
think these people are as bad as you make out. I know
blackmail is practiced over in Italy a lot. And that one of
the favorite ways to get money is to kidnap the son or
daughter of a rich man, and demand a heavy ransom. But
in this case they would hardly pick Nat Scott for a pigeon
to be plucked. His father is only a schoolmaster. There
are others here who would seem to be more attractive bait."</p>

<p>"Hear, hear!" cried Lil Artha, casting a meaning look
in the direction of Larry Billings, whose father, being a
banker, was reckoned the richest man in all Hickory Ridge.</p>

<p>"But ain't we wasting a heap of time here?" asked
Red, impatient as always to be doing something.</p>

<p>"That's just what I was saying to Ted here," declared
Larry, whom the meaning glance of Lil Artha had plainly
rendered uneasy.</p>

<p>"You may think so," remarked Elmer, "but this is
a case of the more haste the less speed. I reckon it's wise
for us to make sure about the character of these Italians
before we go to chasing after them. They're an excitable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
lot, you know, and we might bring on trouble that could
just as well be avoided if we went slow."</p>

<p>Matty looked at his leader sharply.</p>

<p>"Say, see here, Elmer," he remarked, "you know, or
anyhow you've got a pretty good hunch, who these people
are?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, Italians," laughed the other.</p>

<p>"Now, that ain't what I mean," Matty went on. "No
dodging, but own up."</p>

<p>"You're wrong there," Elmer said. "I don't know,
and my suspicions so far are founded on such slight evidence
that I don't care to commit myself before the whole
of you&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>"But from what you said just now," Matty continued,
"you don't seem to agree with the rest of us when we call
these Italians anarchists."</p>

<p>"Because there hasn't been a solitary thing to prove it.
We pathfinders must always discover some trace of the trail,
or else we'd go astray. And I've owned up that I'm more
than half inclined to believe these people are not the bad
lot you'd make out."</p>

<p>"But they've got our chum a prisoner," said Red.</p>

<p>"Looks that way," assented Elmer, cheerfully.</p>

<p>"And honest men would never do a thing like that,"
declared Red.</p>

<p>"Oh, wouldn't they?" replied the other. "Perhaps
now the shoe might be on the other foot."</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"And perhaps these honest people might suspect that
you three fellows in uniform represented the great United<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
States army about to surround them, and make them prisoners
because they had been occupying private property
here at Munsey's mill."</p>

<p>The scouts looked at one another, astonished. Here was
a theory then which had never appealed to them before.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare!" gasped Red.</p>

<p>"Don't it just beat the Dutch how he gets on to all
these things?" said Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"But, Elmer, why take poor Nat a prisoner, bottle him
up so he couldn't call for help, fetch him to this old shack,
and finally carry him off when they light out!"</p>

<p>It was Matty who asked this question. Elmer smiled and
shook his head.</p>

<p>"I can figure out a lot of things," he said, "just as
I can read Indian writing; but please don't expect me
to tell you what people <i>think</i>. I only know that these Italians
were surely frightened at the sudden appearance of
three fellows in khaki, and that they probably took them
for soldiers. They must have had some idea in view when
they captured Nat, and hustled him to this shack. Perhaps
they only meant to hide here until the rest of us had gone."</p>

<p>"And they got more scared when you sounded that
bugle, I reckon," remarked Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"Yes, and then the coming of another bunch of six scouts
may have made them believe the worst was about to happen,"
Elmer continued.</p>

<p>"Say, I thought I heard low voices when I was just
going to peep in that window there, and the bugle called
me back to duty," Landy spoke up.</p>

<p>"Yes," Elmer added; "and it may be the coming of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Landy just finished their panic. After he went away they
must have vamosed the ranch in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Well, all this is mighty interesting, sure," declared
Red, with an appreciative nod, "but it ain't bringing us
any closer to finding our chum Nat."</p>

<p>"Yes, what's the programme, Elmer?" asked Chatz.
"Do we take up the trail right away, and try to follow
these heah rascals to their new camp? You can count on
all of us, suh, to do the troop credit."</p>

<p>"There may be another way," remarked Elmer, who
seemed to be pondering over the matter.</p>

<p>"Tell us about it, then, please."</p>

<p>"Sometimes it's the best policy to hike after an enemy
as fast as you can put. Then again, there are other times
when a whole lot can be won just by waiting for the enemy
<i>to come to you</i>."</p>

<p>"That's so, fellows," declared Matty; "I see what Elmer
means. He thinks that if we hid out here, we'd be
able to bag the whole blooming crowd soon."</p>

<p>"Sounds all right in theory," admitted Red, "but for
one I'd like to know why Elmer believes that push will
come back after a little."</p>

<p>"I only feel pretty sure on one point," explained the
acting scout master. "And that concerns the woman
alone."</p>

<p>"Meaning, I take it, that you think they'll send her
back, the cowards, to find out whether the coast is clear,"
ventured Red.</p>

<p>"No, they will never have to send her back, fellows,"
Elmer went on, positively.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Won't, eh?" remarked Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"I firmly believe that once we withdraw from this same
old shack the woman will steal back of her own free will."</p>

<p>"To get her precious old comb, mebbe," sneered Red.</p>

<p>"To recover something which I guess she values above
ten thousand combs," and Elmer as he spoke held up the
string of beads forming the rosary.</p>

<p>"In her hurry to get away she must have forgotten all
about this. But I warrant you, fellows, she's discovered the
loss by now. What follows? She makes up her mind that
she's just <i>got</i> to return and find it, if so be we haven't
taken it from that nail where it was hanging when we
came in."</p>

<p>"Good! You've got things down just pat, Elmer. And
then what?" asked Matty.</p>

<p>"I expect to hide near by while the rest of you go
noisily away. She can't know how many came, and she'll
think all have departed. Then, when she comes in I'll
make her a prisoner. Perhaps they'll be glad to exchange
Nat for their woman. Or else, if we can make her understand
that we're only toy soldiers, and mean the men no
harm, she will lead us to their hide-out."</p>

<p>The scouts were listening attentively, as they always did
when Elmer was talking. He possessed such a fund of
interesting information that they knew full well they could
learn many useful things by trying to grasp the ideas he
advanced.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>HOW THE TRAP WORKED.</h3>


<p>"There's only one thing about it that I object to on
general principles," remarked Mark.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Elmer.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't think to stay here alone," the other
went on. "Perhaps one of the men might return with
the woman&mdash;if she does come."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's true; there is a chance," Elmer admitted.</p>

<p>"Well, you see how you'd be up against it then," Mark
went on, earnestly. "A savage Italian woman, who might
have a knife along, would be bad enough for one fellow to
handle."</p>

<p>"That's so, Mark."</p>

<p>"And should there be a dago man along, why, I guess
you'd just have to sit sucking your thumb and not making
a move," Mark continued.</p>

<p>"I reckon I would," laughed Elmer. "All of which
means that you think I ought to pick out a couple of husky
fellows to keep me company."</p>

<p>"That's what I'd do."</p>

<p>"And that you wouldn't mind being one of the same
guards, eh, Mark?"</p>

<p>"I'd enjoy it all right, Elmer."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm thinking that way myself now. You can
hold over with me, then. I'll want another fellow, too.
Let's see," and he glanced at the eager faces by which he
was surrounded: "oh, well, Lil Artha will be the other."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, shucks!" grumbled Red, bitterly disappointed, because
he dearly loved action.</p>

<p>"Matty," said the acting scout master.</p>

<p>"On deck," replied the leader of the Beaver Patrol,
saluting.</p>

<p>"You might try and see how far you've gone in the art
of following a trail. I don't believe these rough fellows
know the first thing about trying to hide their tracks, so
you oughtn't to have a great deal of trouble."</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess I'd be equal to the job so long as they
keep down on the low ground. But if they once start up
the side of the hill, where it's all rocky, I reckon my cake
will be dough, then, Elmer."</p>

<p>"Do your best, anyhow, Matty," the scout master went
on; "nobody can do more. But to tell you the truth, I
believe the first chance lies here."</p>

<p>"You really think, then, the woman will return?" queried
Mark.</p>

<p>"I am almost dead certain of it," Elmer replied. "I've
been among the Italians some in the colony they have on
the outskirts of our town. And I've studied them more or
less. They seem a queer people to us, but their religion
is a big part of their lives&mdash;at least that goes with the
women part of the settlement."</p>

<p>"I think you're right, Elmer," remarked George, who
had not spoken up to now; "I happen to know a little
about the Italians, too, because my father employs a lot
of 'em, you see. Wouldn't be surprised one bit if she
sneaks back here to recover those beads. They mean a heap
to her, fellows."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Everybody stared to hear George talk like that, for as a
rule he was hard to convince; which fact, as has been stated
before, had caused him to be known as "Doubting George."</p>

<p>"Well, let's get busy," suggested Red, who, if he could
not hold over to assist Elmer, at least felt that the sooner
he and the rest started on the trail the better.</p>

<p>"That's the stuff," added Toby, also anxious to be doing
something, he cared little what.</p>

<p>"All right," remarked Elmer, "and, as a first move,
suppose you fellows begin to back out of here. Keep in
a bunch outside. Mark, you and Lil Artha watch for a
chance to drop down in the bushes, and lie as quiet as
church mice till I give the signal, which will be a whistle.
Understand?"</p>

<p>"Sure," replied Lil Artha, pausing in the doorway to
watch Elmer hang up the beads again on the nail where
he had found them; "but why ought we be so particular
about dropping out of sight, if you don't mind telling us?"</p>

<p>"Well, it might be the woman has already returned, and
is hiding somewhere close by, waiting for the crowd to
move."</p>

<p>"That's so," admitted Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"And of course if she even suspected that any of us
hung out she wouldn't try to enter the shack at all," Elmer
pursued.</p>

<p>"Then we'll have to be mighty careful, Mark, how we
do the great vanishing act," the tall scout remarked.</p>

<p>"Wait till the boys happen to bunch around you, then
just drop, and let them go on. But Mark, as you will be
the last one out, suppose you close the door after you, just
as if the shack were empty."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you expecting to hide behind that box, Elmer?"
demanded his chum, pointing to the affair that had evidently
served as a rude table.</p>

<p>"Just what I am," replied the other, promptly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see."</p>

<p>And with one last look around, Mark advanced toward
the exit, beyond which the scouts could be seen talking and
gesturing as Matty looked for the trail left when the Italians
fled in such haste.</p>

<p>Evidently it was Mark's idea to take a good mental impression
of the interior of the shack away with him. This
would prove useful in case there arose a sudden necessity
for his presence, and that of Lil Artha, on the scene of
action.</p>

<p>When the last of his companions had gone, and the rough
door of the shack was swung shut, Elmer hastened to softly
move the big box a little, so that it might suit his purpose
better.</p>

<p>He did not imagine that this would appear suspicious
in the eyes of the woman, should she return for her rosary,
because it was to be expected that in a search of the cabin
such changes were apt to take place.</p>

<p>He could still hear the chatter of many voices outside,
but they were growing fainter. Evidently Matty must have
found the trail he wanted, showing where the four Italians,
together with their prisoner, had left the concealed shack.</p>

<p>So, knowing the value of time in an affair like this,
Elmer hastened to crawl behind the big box.</p>

<p>Anyone entering the room could not see him, nor would
his crouching form be visible from the hole in the shack
wall, intended as a window.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time Elmer had so contrived things that,
by making use of an old bunch of straw which he allowed
to hang over the edge of the table, he was easily able to
keep watch upon both openings, the window and the door.</p>

<p>Then he waited patiently for something to happen.</p>

<p>Some minutes passed.</p>

<p>Outside all seemed as quiet as a Sunday in Hickory
Ridge.</p>

<p>The sound of boyish voices had utterly died away, proving
that Matty must be showing considerable skill in leading
his detachment along a trail.</p>

<p>Indeed, once the presence of human beings no longer
acted as a disturbing element, a little frisky red squirrel
hopped up in the open window and peeped within the shack.</p>

<p>Perhaps the little chap was more or less at home there.
At any rate Elmer was pleased to see him sit up on his
haunches and begin to gnaw at a stray nut he had evidently
discovered.</p>

<p>To his mind the red squirrel was apt to serve in place
of a vidette. Should anyone approach the shack now the
little nut-cracker would give warning by frisking away in
sudden alarm.</p>

<p>So the wide-awake scout finds opportunities to make use
of the most ordinary and commonplace things to be met
with in the woods.</p>

<p>Everything may have a meaning, if only the scout possesses
the key of knowledge so necessary for the unlocking
of the door.</p>

<p>Not moving a finger Elmer simply awaited the turn of
events.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>And not once did he doubt the outcome, so positive was
he that his reasoning must be correct.</p>

<p>If the woman returned alone, he believed they ought to
easily take her prisoner; but, on the other hand, should
one or more of the men accompany her, he must expect
the conditions to be changed, and alter his own plans in
consequence.</p>

<p>Two minutes must have gone by now.</p>

<p>Elmer was not simply guessing this, or, as Lil Artha
would say, "making a blind stab at it." He knew because,
as he crouched there watching, he was continually marking
the flight of time by counting to himself.</p>

<p>In imagination his gaze followed the swinging pendulum
of the big grandfather clock that stood in the hall
of his home.</p>

<p>"Tick, tick, tick!" he could see it go back and forth,
each movement marking the passing of another second of
precious time.</p>

<p>Ah! the squirrel had ceased to work at his nut now.
He even gave signs of sudden alarm, as though his keen
little ratlike ears had caught a foreign sound indicating
the coming of a human being.</p>

<p>And yet Elmer knew positively that he himself had not
moved in the slightest degree, so that the squirrel's panic
could not be laid at his door.</p>

<p>"I guess something's going to happen," he thought,
"unless either Mark or Lil Artha showed themselves recklessly;
and I don't believe they'd do it."</p>

<p>He continued to watch his four-footed little sentinel
perched up there in the apology for a window.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Even as he looked the timid squirrel vanished as suddenly
as it had appeared.</p>

<p>Elmer only silently chuckled, quite satisfied with the
way things were working.</p>

<p>And he somehow still continued to keep his eyes glued
on that hole in the wall, as though laboring under the
impression that when the Italian woman did come she would
first of all appear in that particular quarter.</p>

<p>And he was right.</p>

<p>Even as he looked he discovered a suspicious movement
in the gap. This was brought about by the uplifting of
a human hand, upon the fingers of which he could count
at least five broad rings without settings.</p>

<p>Perhaps the owner of that hand was on her knees, and
in this manner sought to rise up.</p>

<p>Elmer, still looking, saw a head presently fill part of
the crude window.</p>

<p>It was a woman who stared in, there could be no questioning
that fact. And so far as he could tell she seemed
to be alone, for he neither saw nor heard any sign of a
second party.</p>

<p>Once he knew her burning gaze was fastened upon the
bunch of straw which he had arranged so as to serve as a
veil, back of which he might continue to watch what was
taking place.</p>

<p>Elmer fairly held his breath, fearing that she might
have discovered the lurker, or at least entertained suspicions
regarding his presence there.</p>

<p>But not so.</p>

<p>Her eyes, having swept back and forth until they had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
fairly covered the whole interior of the dimly lighted shack,
seemed to be attracted toward one particular spot.</p>

<p>This was where the string of beads hung from the nail
driven into a log.</p>

<p>It was the lodestone which had served to draw this
woman once more into the danger zone.</p>

<p>And from that instant, if Elmer had allowed the slightest
doubt to creep into his mind before, it no longer found
lodgment there.</p>

<p>The woman was bound to enter in order to obtain possession
of that precious string of beads.</p>

<p>Once she thrust her head and shoulders through the
opening and attempted to clutch the rosary, but the effort
was useless.</p>

<p>"Now she is coming!"</p>

<p>Elmer whispered this to himself as he saw that the
woman no longer occupied the opening&mdash;she had undoubtedly
started for the door.</p>

<p>Yes, now he could see the closed door begin to quiver,
as though eager hands had started to open it.</p>

<p>Elmer held his breath with eagerness, and all the while
watched the door.</p>

<p>Between his strong teeth the scout master held a little
German silver whistle, such as patrol leaders usually carry
for signaling purposes.</p>

<p>This he expected to sound when the time was ripe, and
he had every reason to believe that his two comrades would
rush into the shack the very instant they heard the call.</p>

<p>Now the door was surely opening wider. Even in her
hurry the Italian woman did not forget the need of due<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
caution when all these enemies seemed to be hanging
around.</p>

<p>Her experiences across the ocean may have made her
exceedingly ill disposed to trust anything that wore a
uniform.</p>

<p>Yes, the door had given way by now to admit a moving
figure, and then it was drawn shut again.</p>

<p>Elmer smiled to see how closely his guess had come to
the actual truth. The Italian woman was not only squatty,
and "broad of beam," as Lil Artha would have put it,
but, as Elmer had said, might be close on sixty years of
age, for she had many wrinkles, and her hair was certainly
gray.</p>

<p>She left the door unfastened behind her. Elmer chuckled
to himself under his breath, for he saw that in doing this
the woman had not only left a way of speedy escape open
for herself in case of necessity, but also a free passage for
the scouts when the signal whistle blew.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>RUN DOWN.</h3>


<p>Straight across the floor of the shack glided the woman.</p>

<p>She was making a bee line for the string of beads with
the little silver cross at the double end.</p>

<p>And the hidden scout could hear the low words of musical
Italian flowing from her lips when she reached out an
eager hand to seize upon the sacred article.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Now was his time.</p>

<p>The critical moment had arrived when he must proceed
to spring his trap.</p>

<p>As silently as he could, then, Elmer arose to his feet.
He was behind the woman and could never bring himself
to believe that he had made even the slightest sound when
rising.</p>

<p>Then the only explanation left was that the woman happened
to be in front of the broken looking glass at the moment,
bent on fastening the beads about her thick neck.
And if so, she must have discovered him as he arose from
behind the big box.</p>

<p>At any rate she uttered a cry that to his mind was not
unlike the snarl of a wild beast. He saw the almost savage
look that came over her swarthy face, and knew that
after all, such a woman was fully as much to be feared as
the stoutest ladrone.</p>

<p>And so Elmer did not think it was unworthy of a true
scout to send out the call for help.</p>

<p>The woman might be disposed to defy just one half-grown
lad, whereas if she believed herself to be up against
the whole troop she would submit with the best grace she
could command.</p>

<p>And so he blew a shrill blast that must bring both Mark
and Lil Artha dashing to the spot.</p>

<p>The effect upon the woman was rather surprising.</p>

<p>Perhaps Elmer might have expected seeing her cower
down, seized with a sudden overwhelming fear, but nothing
of the kind occurred.</p>

<p>To his surprise she snatched out a wicked-looking knife<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
from the bosom of her dress. It looked to Elmer like a
broken kitchen knife that had been ground down to a
point. With such a blade he remembered seeing the Italian
women from the settlement just outside Hickory Ridge
wandering around in the early spring, digging dandelion
plants for "greens."</p>

<p>He could hear the rush of approaching footsteps even
as the woman sprang for the door with a wild look on her
face.</p>

<p>The other two scouts had of course caught his shrill
signal, and were hastening to join their leader.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly both Mark and Lil Artha must have seen
the woman, if not while she was looking in at the window,
then when she turned the corner of the hidden shack to
enter by the door.</p>

<p>And hence they would surely understand that there was
no man opposed to their combined force.</p>

<p>The fact of the woman being armed with so terrible a
weapon as a knife, and that look of grim determination
on her dark face, alarmed Elmer.</p>

<p>What if she attacked the two scouts&mdash;what if in her sudden
panic she wounded either of his chums? There could be
no telling what a fear-crazed, ignorant woman, strong as
an ox, and almost as irresponsible, might do in an emergency
like this.</p>

<p>Of course he would have only been too well pleased
could he have shown the woman that it was all a mistake,
and that they meant her no ill.</p>

<p>But with her brandishing that wicked-looking knife and
leaping for the door, there was certainly no opportunity
for argument.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Elmer sprang forward.</p>

<p>His main idea was to try and knock that blade from her
grasp by striking sharply on her arm or her knuckles.</p>

<p>At the same time he thought to warn the other scouts,
so that they might take due precautions when suddenly
brought face to face with the Italian woman who was running
amuck.</p>

<p>Perhaps when they heard him shout they would just
naturally believe he was being hard pressed. And in that
case, instead of deterring them, his cries would only further
spur the others on.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Elmer lifted his voice in warning:</p>

<p>"Look out, boys! She's got a knife, and is coming out
at you! Take care there!"</p>

<p>Just then something happened.</p>

<p>The woman had not turned her head as Elmer thus gave
tongue, as might a hound on the warm trail of the fox.</p>

<p>She kept straight on. The door was before her, and
while she had drawn it shut after entering, it has been
mentioned before that she made no attempt to fasten the
same.</p>

<p>So now, when she hurled her whole weight against the
barrier it flew outward with a jump.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, the two scouts had managed to
reach the door at exactly the same time. And that second
chanced to be the identical one when the frightened foreigner
crashed into the door.</p>

<p>There could only be one result, and that filled with bitterness
and woe to both Lil Artha and Mark. As the
uncouth door was thrown suddenly outward, as if forced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
by a battering ram from within, it struck the scouts a tremendous
blow.</p>

<p>They crumpled up and went over. A couple of ten-pins
struck by a swiftly hurled ball could hardly have collapsed
more ingloriously than did Lil Artha and his mate.</p>

<p>Indeed, the long-legged scout seemed to perform a complete
revolution in the air, landing on his knees among
the bushes.</p>

<p>Two seconds later, when Elmer dashed out of the shack,
this was the astonishing spectacle he saw&mdash;the woman running
away as best her bulk allowed, casting glances that
were half frightened, half triumphant, behind her; while
Mark was sitting up, rubbing a bump on his forehead ruefully,
and Lil Artha had taken out a handkerchief to dab
at his bleeding nose.</p>

<p>Still, nothing short of an earthquake could ever bottle
up the flow of animal spirits that usually possessed the
lanky one.</p>

<p>While he applied his handkerchief until it looked particularly
gory, he was bent upon giving expression to his
views.</p>

<p>"Wow! and again I say, wow! What cyclone was that
we ran up against, Elmer? Did you let fly with that club
of yours, or did the old shack just take a notion to fall
over on us? It felt like I was being kicked by an army
mule."</p>

<p>"Same here, Elmer," lamented Mark, as he succeeded
in struggling to his feet.</p>

<p>"Well, it wasn't anything like that at all," declared
Elmer, hastily; "and if you take the trouble to look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
yonder, before your eyes begin to close up, you'll see what
hit you, running away like a scared hippopotamus."</p>

<p>"Glory be! Was it that dago woman?" yelled Lil Artha,
now on his feet again.</p>

<p>"Yes, she burst the door open when she saw me, and as
you chanced to be in the way, why, you got the benefit,
that's all," Elmer remarked.</p>

<p>"Don't let her get away, fellows! Come on, who's
afraid? We can cover three feet to her one. Let's make
her a prisoner," shouted Lil Artha, whose usually even
temper seemed to have been decidedly ruffled by his recent
mishap.</p>

<p>So the three scouts left the shack and began to rush
after the fleeing Italian woman.</p>

<p>Of course she knew immediately that she was being pursued.
She tried to increase her pace, but evidently with
little success. Short, dumpy people can never hope to
compete with slim, long-legged greyhounds like Lil Artha.</p>

<p>And so, almost from the start, the three scouts began to
close in upon the fleeing Italian woman.</p>

<p>"Say, she's got a bloody old knife," gasped Lil Artha,
as they struggled on through the woods where the creeping
vines and the underbrush, not to mention frequent
logs and occasional woodchuck holes, made running a desperate
business.</p>

<p>"That's so, Elmer," piped up Mark, "I saw her shake
it at us then."</p>

<p>"I know it, fellows," said the scout master, "and that's
what I was shouting about, to warn you."</p>

<p>"Are we gaining any, Elmer? I can't see just as well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
as I'd like, with this thing up to my nose," the lanky runner
asked.</p>

<p>"Pulling up on her fast, my boy," came the reassuring
answer.</p>

<p>"And what're we goin' to do when she turns on us?"
demanded Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"First of all, surround her."</p>

<p>"That sounds good as far as she goes. What next?"</p>

<p>"We must try and knock that nasty thing out of her
hand by a sharp blow on the arm," continued Elmer, who
strangely enough seemed as cool as a cucumber, while
both of his companions showed the effect of the mad pace.</p>

<p>"I tumble to it, Elmer," gasped Lil Artha, "and I'm
the fellow to give that lovely little tap. I made Red drop
his stick seven times when we were having a bout with
long sticks, and which we pretended were the old-style
quarterstaves."</p>

<p>Even the long-legged Lil Artha must see now that the
distance separating the pursuers from the fugitive had been
greatly shortened. Another five minutes would see them
overhaul the woman, unless something not down on the
bills came to pass.</p>

<p>Five minutes&mdash;why there would surely be ample time to
bring this result about, judging by the way they were covering
two yards to her one.</p>

<p>The woman knew it, too.</p>

<p>She was becoming more and more anxious. This was
shown by the way she kept turning her head from time
to time as she ran.</p>

<p>Elmer knew what was apt to happen. For himself he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
found that he had need of both his eyes with every step
forward he took through that tangle, where trailing vines
lay in wait to trip him up, and branches hung low as if
seeking to catch in his hair, to make him another Absalom.</p>

<p>Already had Lil Artha gone down with a thud, but as
he said himself, his "dander" was aroused, and no little
things like this could be allowed to interfere with his pursuit.</p>

<p>So he had hastily scrambled to his feet and followed at
the heels of his more fortunate chums, a sight calculated
to excite wild laughter among the rest of the troop, with
his blood-flecked face.</p>

<p>At any rate Lil Artha was game to the backbone, and
Elmer often remembered it afterward when "trying out"
his scouts.</p>

<p>The closer they drew to the fleeing woman the greater
her fright seemed to become.</p>

<p>Whenever he saw her looking backward over her shoulder
Elmer would make pantomime gestures with his free hand.</p>

<p>He was trying the best he knew how to tell her to give
over this foolish flight, and that they had no hostile intentions.</p>

<p>But the chances were she interpreted these movements
just the other way, and believed he must be threatening
her with all sorts of terrible things unless she yielded herself
a prisoner to their prowess.</p>

<p>Well, no matter, it could hardly last more than another
minute or so. Do what she would the woman must find it
utterly impossible to get away.</p>

<p>Already the active mind of the young scout master was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
busy, weaving a clever scheme by means of which they
could surround the woman, and by attacking her all at
once, succeed in knocking the shining knife out of her
hand.</p>

<p>No doubt he would have succeeded in doing the job,
too, had conditions continued to make such a move necessary.</p>

<p>But they did not.</p>

<p>The fickle hand of Fate came in between just in time to
share in the matter.</p>

<p>It seemed to Elmer that they were constantly getting
into a more tangled mess of undergrowth. All around and
ahead were traps calculated to slyly catch unwary feet and
trip them up.</p>

<p>Suddenly Elmer gave vent to a low gasping cry; but
while Mark involuntarily turned his head to learn if his
companion had gone lame, to his surprise and gratification
he found the other running as smoothly and easily as ever,
as though perfectly fresh.</p>

<p>"The woman!" shrieked Lil Artha, who, apparently,
from his position in the rear had been enabled to see just
what had happened.</p>

<p>"Where&mdash;is&mdash;she?" gasped Mark, once more allowing
his eyes to travel ahead.</p>

<p>For, apparently, the fleeing Italian had vanished at that
instant, as completely as though the earth had opened and
swallowed her up.</p>

<p>"She's down&mdash;caught her foot in a root!" cried Elmer,
not slackening his warm pace, for he wanted to make a
quick job of the thing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Mark saw that some object was threshing the bushes
furiously. Twice the woman tried to rise, but on each occasion
she fell back again.</p>

<p>Then presently he gave a shout as he guessed the true
situation.</p>

<p>"She's caught fast in a vine, Elmer. Even the woods
work with us! I tell you she's a prisoner right now! All
we've got to do is to tie her hands!"</p>

<p>"But look out for that dandelion knife, boys," warned
Elmer, as the three of them reached the spot.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>THE LANGUAGE OF SIGNS.</h3>


<p>It happened just as the boys had expected. While turning
her head so often to see how near these persistent pursuers
were, the woman had caught her foot in a stout vine.</p>

<p>She had been hurled to the ground with considerable
force, but apparently received no serious injury. When
she tried to regain her feet, however, on each occasion the
clinging vine refused to release its hold. As a consequence
she went down again.</p>

<p>Finally, as though realizing the uselessness of further
struggling against Fate, the woman stopped trying to get
up.</p>

<p>Having twisted around in some manner, she just sat there
and stared at the three boys in khaki.</p>

<p>"Now she's wondering what we're going to do," said
Mark, as they stood with the woman between them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, she's frightened again, poor thing," remarked
Elmer. "I'm afraid it's these uniforms that have done it.
She surely takes us for soldiers, and thinks we've come
here just to arrest the whole bunch."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of one thing, though," said Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"What might that be?" asked Elmer.</p>

<p>"Looks like she must have dropped that fierce frog
sticker when she fell, because you notice she hasn't got the
old knife in her claws just now."</p>

<p>"That's right," admitted Mark, cheerfully, for the fact
naturally pleased him.</p>

<p>"And here it is, right at my feet," said Elmer, as he
stooped and took something from the ground.</p>

<p>It was the knife which the Italian woman had flourished
so recklessly.</p>

<p>"My stars, what a savage-looking thing!" ejaculated
Lil Artha, as he stared at the knife.</p>

<p>"Well, it does look wicked for a fact," remarked Elmer;
"but after all, I reckon she's never done anything with it
but cut dandelion greens, or else prepared fish," and he took
occasion to bring the blade close to his nose while speaking,
only to make a face, as though the fishy odor that clung
to the steel might be far from pleasant.</p>

<p>"Well, we've overhauled the lady; now whatever are
we going to do with her?" demanded the tall scout.</p>

<p>"I wonder if she understands English?" remarked
Elmer.</p>

<p>"Try her and see," Mark suggested.</p>

<p>The woman had been watching them keenly all this while.
Her manner suggested that she might be trying to read her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
fate more from their actions than any words which they
would let fall.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Elmer stepped forward a pace.</p>

<p>"No hurt," he said, in the gentlest tone he could muster;
"friends&mdash;boys&mdash;no soldiers."</p>

<p>"She don't savvy worth a cent, Elmer," said Lil Artha,
in disgust.</p>

<p>"And her eyes keep following your movements with the
knife, as if she thought you meant to strike her," observed
Mark.</p>

<p>Elmer himself saw that this was a fact. Plainly, then,
the woman could not understand English, and in her present
state of fright she seemed incapable of reading his
reassuring gestures. What he meant to be a sign of friendliness
she interpreted as a symbol of hostility.</p>

<p>"Seems to me we ought first of all to get her foot free
from that nasty tangle," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Sure, and I guess the only way to do it is to cut the
plagued old vine," said Lil Artha. "But I guess I hadn't
ought to run the thing down, because it served us a mighty
good turn just now."</p>

<p>"Step in and cut the vine, Elmer," suggested Mark.</p>

<p>When, however, the young scout master had taken a
step or two forward, knife in hand, the woman's fears
were once more aroused.</p>

<p>She threw herself forward, struggling violently to release
her trapped foot. But the vine proved as strong as a new
clothesline, and held tenaciously.</p>

<p>"Good gracious, what a silly goose!" exclaimed Lil Artha,
"when all we want to do is to set her free."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you see she don't look at it that way. The poor
creature thinks we're conspiring to turn the tables on her,
just because she threatened us with this knife. Here, hold
it, Mark."</p>

<p>Elmer handed over the knife to his chum at a moment
when he saw that the woman's eyes were fastened upon him.</p>

<p>Then he held up both his hands as he smiled reassuringly.
It was the universal "peace sign" known throughout the
world. Hardly a savage tribe in the heart of Darkest Africa
but would recognize the meaning it expressed.</p>

<p>This time when he advanced the Italian woman did not
struggle again. She watched him. Curiosity was overcoming
fear. Perhaps she had even begun to realize that these
dreadful soldiers did not present such a savage front
after all.</p>

<p>So Elmer dropped down on his knees, at a point where
he could come in contact with her imprisoned foot, and
the wiry vine that gripped it.</p>

<p>A brief examination convinced him that since she had
turned around several times during her violent struggle to
break away, the only means of freeing the entrapped foot
was to cut the vine.</p>

<p>Of course that meant the knife again, and if he asked
Mark to hand it to him, possibly the foolish foreigner would
have another fit of terror.</p>

<p>So Elmer commenced to use tact again.</p>

<p>First of all he commenced to work at the vine, the woman
watching him eagerly.</p>

<p>"No use, pardner," remarked Lil Artha. "That thing
is like steel bands, and the old woman has managed to tie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
herself up handsomely. Nothing but a knife, and a sharp
one, too, will do the business."</p>

<p>"I know it," replied Elmer, quietly. "I'm only pretending
to try and get her foot out just to make her understand
that we want to help her. Now just watch me, and
see how I manage."</p>

<p>Presently, as if despairing of success, he ceased his labor.
Then he pointed to the vine, and made several slashes across
it with his forefinger, after which he pointed to the knife
Mark was holding out, and nodded his head.</p>

<p>The woman was interested.</p>

<p>"Go through it all again; she's beginning to understand,"
said Mark, himself deeply interested in the success
of this deaf and dumb method of communication.</p>

<p>"Well, of all the stupids going, give me one of these
same dagoes," grumbled Lil Artha. "Why, you make it
plain enough for a Hottentot to grab, Elmer. But I'm beginning
to hope she'll get on soon. Try her once more,
pardner. You're the boss hand at wig-wagging. Give her
the high sign, Elmer."</p>

<p>Deliberately Elmer again pretended to cut the vine with
his forefinger, then shook his head and afterward pointed
to the knife.</p>

<p>The woman's black eyes followed each movement, and
evidently she began to grasp the idea that he did not desire
the weapon so as to injure, but to assist her.</p>

<p>"Glory be!" ejaculated Lil Artha, who had been almost
holding his breath with suspense while all this pantomime
business was going on, "look at that, would you, fellows?
A bright thought has managed to get a foothold in her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
brain. I bet you it needed a sledge hammer to pound it in.
Say, she's beginning to smile at you, Elmer. You've won
out. She believes you mean all right. Give him the toad-sticker,
Mark, and let him get to work."</p>

<p>Elmer knew that his actions would no longer be misconstrued.
The Italian woman understood.</p>

<p>So he held out his hand and received the knife from
Mark. The woman moved uneasily, but the smile Elmer
gave her was surely enough to disarm any lingering suspicion
she may have entertained.</p>

<p>Of course it was only a small job now to cut through the
obstinate vine at a point where the greatest holding point
lay.</p>

<p>"There you are!" remarked Lil Artha, as the knife
severed the last strand.</p>

<p>The woman got slowly to her feet. She folded her arms
across her bosom with what seemed to be an air of resignation.
Yet Elmer knew that all the while those sparkling
black eyes were watching him intently.</p>

<p>The woman had guessed that Elmer must be the leader
of the three strangers in uniform. Hence she looked to him
for orders.</p>

<p>"Well, what're we going to do with this pretty thing,
now that we've got it?" remarked Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"I suppose, first of all, we ought to go back to the
shack," said Elmer.</p>

<p>"You mean to hold her a prisoner, I take it?" asked
Mark, who had the utmost faith in the acting scout master's
ability to grasp the situation.</p>

<p>"That's about the only thing open to us," Elmer replied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
"Through the woman perhaps we can get in touch
with the three men who are holding Nat Scott a prisoner,
and bring about his release."</p>

<p>"I don't see how," grumbled Lil Artha. "If you had
all that trouble getting her to understand you only meant
to cut the old vine, and not her foot off, how in the dickens
d'ye expect to get her to know we don't mean to do her
bunch any harm?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there may be ways," smiled Elmer.</p>

<p>"But you don't speak Italiano, Elmer; that's dead sure,
else you'd have used it right now to tell her you only
wanted to cut the vine," Lil Artha went on.</p>

<p>"How about George?" remarked Elmer.</p>

<p>"What! George Robbins?" asked the tall scout.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, you remember he told us his father employs
a large number of these foreigners, and unless I'm mistaken
I think I remember hearing George say he'd been picking
up quite a lot of Italian words."</p>

<p>"That sounds all to the good then," declared Lil Artha,
with enthusiasm. "Bully for George! His knowledge
may be the key that's going to unlock this old padlock for
us."</p>

<p>"Then let's get back to the shack. Fall in around the
woman. That ought to tell her what we want her to do."</p>

<p>Elmer, as he spoke, took up his position alongside the
prisoner, while Mark and the long-legged scout clapped
their sticks to their right shoulders as though parading
arms.</p>

<p>Then Elmer pointed backward in the direction they had
just come from.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go!" he said, impressively.</p>

<p>Whether the prisoner understood the word, or judged
from their actions what was required, Elmer could not say.
All he cared for was the fact that when he started off she
accompanied him, limping a little as though she might
have twisted her ankle somewhat in the violence of her
struggles, looking sullen rather than fearful now, and apparently
resigned to her fate, whatever that might prove
to be.</p>

<p>There was no difficulty about reaching the abandoned
shack again. All Elmer had to do was to follow the broad
trail they had made when chasing after the fleeing woman.</p>

<p>They found no change when they presently drew up at
the hidden retreat. Nor was there any sign of the other
scouts, though once Elmer thought he did hear loud and
excited voices up on the side of the mountain, as though
Matty and his detachment might have found it necessary
to leave the lowlands, and were having troubles of their
own.</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Lil Artha, as they arrived in front
of the shack, "here we are, all to the good, and right
side up with care. The question is, what d'ye expect to
do with the signorina, now that you've got her?"</p>

<p>"She must be kept a prisoner in the shanty until we
can decide on our course, and get George here," replied
Elmer, so readily that the others understood how he must
have his plan of action fully mapped out in his own mind.</p>

<p>"Let's see you usher her in, then," chuckled the tall
scout, just as though he anticipated enjoying a treat when
Elmer tried to "shoo" the Italian woman into the place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>But it proved the easiest thing possible. When Elmer
took her by the arm and pointed to the open door the
woman gave him one look, shook herself free from his
grasp, and hastened to vanish within the shack.</p>

<p>"Easy as falling off a log," declared Lil Artha, a shade
of disappointment in his voice, for he had anticipated more
or less of a struggle.</p>

<p>Elmer quietly closed the door.</p>

<p>"How are you going to fasten it?" asked Mark.</p>

<p>"I wish that was the hardest nut I had to crack,"
laughed the scout master. "Fortunately the door opens
outwardly."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, you mean," echoed Mark, as he touched
the painful lump on his forehead.</p>

<p>"I say yes to that," grinned Lil Artha, whose nose
had stopped bleeding by this time, but whose face was a
sight to behold, being smeared with all manner of strange
red marks that made him resemble an Apache Indian on
the warpath.</p>

<p>"As it does open outwardly, however," Elmer went on
saying, with a sympathetic smile for the woes of his chums,
"it ought to be easy enough for us to barricade the door.
Look around, boys, and see if you can find several good stout
sticks about three or four feet long. Even a small tree
trunk would be about what we want."</p>

<p>"And I think I know where to find one," said Lil Artha,
hastening away, "because I took a header over it
when we were chasing the dago woman."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>THE CALL OF THE WOLF.</h3>


<p>"That's the ticket, Lil Artha," said Elmer, as the tall
scout returned presently, bearing on his shoulder quite a
good-sized log about five feet in length.</p>

<p>"Reckon that ought to hold all right," panted the burden
bearer, as he cast the small tree trunk at Elmer's feet.</p>

<p>"Fine and dandy," commented Mark, beginning to
get the barricade in position.</p>

<p>Of course the log had to be planted in such a way that
it might secure a grip on the door. This meant that it
must incline at an angle of more than forty-five degrees.</p>

<p>Elmer dug a little hole, first of all, at a certain distance
from the door, after the length of the log had been tested.</p>

<p>Then, with the help of his chums, he seated one end of
the log firmly in this. When the other end was allowed
to slip down the face of the door it rested about halfway.</p>

<p>"No danger of that slipping loose if she tries to push
out," remarked Elmer.</p>

<p>Mark gave several additional pulls downward at the
upper end of the log, to make it still firmer.</p>

<p>"I'll just wager," he said, finally, "that nobody, man
or woman, could open that door now from the inside."</p>

<p>"How about the window?" asked Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"You might manage to crawl through that small opening,
but that broad-beamed woman, never," declared the
scout master, positively.</p>

<p>"Then we've got our wild bird safely caged."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"Looks like it, for the time being, anyhow," was the
way Elmer replied.</p>

<p>"Say, see here, you don't seem to go very strong on the
jail business. What's on your mind now, Elmer?" and
Lil Artha confronted the other as he spoke, lifting a reproachful
finger at him.</p>

<p>"Well, there's many a slip between the cup and the lip,
you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, rats! Get down to business, Elmer. What might
happen to upset our plans?" asked the tall scout.</p>

<p>"One of the men might return."</p>

<p>"And of course throw down the log and liberate our
prisoner. But between you and me and the lamp-post,
Elmer, I don't believe that's going to happen. 'Cause why?
Well, it's my honest belief that this Italiano woman's got
all the nerve there is in that crowd. The men are cowards."</p>

<p>"I'm rather of the same opinion, Artha," remarked
Elmer. "And I've thought that same thing more than
once when watching some of them in their settlement."</p>

<p>"But how about your other reason, Elmer?" asked Lil
Artha. "Suppose now the men don't come, what danger
is there of her getting out? D'ye expect she could burrow
under the walls like we did once up at that old lumber
camp?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But I was thinking of another thing. Notice
how poorly this shack is put together? Why, if that
Amazon got on the rampage and just took a notion, I
believe she could bring the whole business down in ruins
about her head."</p>

<p>"Wow, I guess she could, Elmer!" remarked the tall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
boy, nodding his head, "just like Samson did long ago
when he yanked the temple down, and kicked the bucket
himself, with all his enemies. But I don't think this dull-witted
creature's got sense enough for that; do you?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. I hope she won't, anyhow, because I
mean to leave you and Mark here to guard our prisoner
while I'm gone," said Elmer.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see, you want to join the rest of the troop. Perhaps
you've got a hunch they might be needing you about
now?" Lil Artha observed.</p>

<p>"One thing I know, and that is they've left the low
ground and gone up the side of the mountain."</p>

<p>"I guessed that myself when I heard some of the fellers
callin' up yonder. So it stands to reason they've lost
the trail among the rocks," Lil Artha went on.</p>

<p>"I expect as much," Elmer said, "and you know that
since the men carried Nat Scott away with them we've
just got to find them sooner or later."</p>

<p>"But why d'ye suppose now they'd be so pesky mean
as to climb the hill?" demanded the tall scout.</p>

<p>"Oh, perhaps they guessed it would be harder for anyone
to track them up there," Elmer answered.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's so," Mark put in; "or it might be they
know of some fine cave up yonder where they can hide.
You often run across caves, big and little, on stony hills."</p>

<p>Elmer seemed to agree with this suggestion, for he nodded
his head after Mark had advanced it.</p>

<p>"Do you think you can manage?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, we'd be a pretty pair of scouts, wouldn't we
now, if we failed to make good on a job like this?" scoffed
Lil Artha.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>He threw his staff over his shoulder, gun fashion, and
began tramping up and down before the door of the hidden
shack, just as though he were a military sentry on
duty.</p>

<p>"I guess you'll do all right, Lil Artha," laughed Elmer.</p>

<p>"Before you go, Elmer," said Mark, "please tell us just
why you believe these Italians haven't meant to hurt our
chum Nat."</p>

<p>"Well, I just seem to feel it in my bones, and that's
about all I can say," returned the other. "I'm more
convinced now than ever that it's going to turn out only
a silly mistake on their part. Perhaps they've been doing
something here that's against the law, and the sight of
our uniforms threw them into a panic. They've carried
Nat off with them just so he couldn't give the alarm, and
bring the rest down on 'em."</p>

<p>"Counterfeiting, perhaps," suggested Mark. "Seems to
me I've heard that the Italians are pretty smart at that
sort of thing."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't imagine it's anything as serious as that,"
Elmer replied.</p>

<p>"Then tell us what you <i>do</i> think," demanded Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"You <i>will</i> force my hand, will you?" laughed Elmer.</p>

<p>"It's only fair to tell us," pleaded the tall scout.</p>

<p>"Well, all right, seeing that I'm more than ever convinced
I'm on the right track. Here, smell that, both of
you and tell me what it reminds you of."</p>

<p>He thrust the queer, sharp-pointed knife that had been
taken from the woman into the hand of Lil Artha.</p>

<p>That individual immediately raised it to his nose, took
one good smell, and made a wry face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ugh! rank fishy odor, all right!" he declared.</p>

<p>"Then look back a bit, Lil Artha," Elmer continued.
"Don't you remember that in the mill and cottage we discovered
a strong fishy smell when we tried to investigate
that underground place?"</p>

<p>"You're right, we did," assented the tall scout; "it
made me feel a bit squeamish, too, for if there's one thing
I can't stomach it's rank fish. Ugh!"</p>

<p>"I see what you're leading up to, Elmer," announced
Mark, briskly, "and I must say it looks as if there might
be a whole lot of truth in it, too."</p>

<p>"These Italians are often fishermen. A cousin of mine
once told me that along the Gulf coast and around New
Orleans the whole fishing industry lies in their hands,"
Elmer went on.</p>

<p>"Then you believe this bunch is getting fish out of
Munsey mill pond, and selling them, perhaps over in Scarsdale?"
said Mark.</p>

<p>"They are netting fish illegally, I imagine," Elmer answered.
"That would explain their alarm. Perhaps the
game warden has been around and threatened to have them
hauled in if they didn't take warning. And ever since that
time they've been on the nervous lookout."</p>

<p>"Gee, I bet you now that's what it means, fellows!"
declared Lil Artha, filled with new enthusiasm, as he
grasped the startling idea advanced by the scout master.</p>

<p>"And I never saw so many big frogs as there are around
here," Elmer went on.</p>

<p>"That's because even the boys keep away from the
haunted mill," Mark added.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"You know how frogs sell in the market, and how it
would pay anybody to catch a few hundred such jumboes
as there are here," Elmer remarked.</p>

<p>"Well, it does take you to figure things out just, I must
say," laughed Mark.</p>

<p>"He's a wizard, that's what," declared Lil Artha, whose
admiration for his leader was boundless.</p>

<p>"Not at all," smiled the other; "a little common sense
was all that was needed. The strong odor of fish in that
cellar put me on the track first. You know there's an
old saying to the effect that where there's smoke there must
be fire."</p>

<p>"And then this knife, too&mdash;like as not the woman does
all the cleaning of the fish. I thought she reminded me of
black bass or pickerel, I wasn't sure which," Lil Artha
stated, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"But we've been around more or less, Elmer," Mark
put in, "and I don't remember seeing any signs of fish
cleaning, scales or anything."</p>

<p>"Of course not," came the quick reply. "If these people
knew they were breaking the law, and expected the game
warden to pop in on them any day, you can just believe
they'd be mighty careful to hide all traces of this thing."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they throw it all back in the pond for fish
bait," suggested the tall scout.</p>

<p>"Not a bad idea," commented Elmer.</p>

<p>"And the cellar under the mill cottage?" asked Mark.</p>

<p>"They might use that as a cool place to keep the fish until
they can get them to market," Elmer replied.</p>

<p>"That's a fact, seeing they have no ice to pack them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
in," Lil Artha observed. "And the more I think of it
all, the better it looks to me, fellows."</p>

<p>"Then you believe my explanation may be the true
answer to our chum's vanishing?"</p>

<p>"I sure do."</p>

<p>"That they came upon him by accident," Elmer went
on, "and filled with a sudden panic, just captured him to
keep Nat from calling out, and bringing the rest of us
around?"</p>

<p>"That's what they did," Lil Artha affirmed. "And no
matter how sorry they might be afterward because they
did it, they just can't drop him now."</p>

<p>"Then, since we've agreed on that point I don't see the
need of my hanging around here any longer," Elmer observed,
drawing his belt one notch tighter, as though preparing
for new labors.</p>

<p>"And your orders are just the same?" Mark asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, you two keep guard over the shack, and don't
let the prisoner get away, if you can prevent it."</p>

<p>"Depend on us, Elmer. And say," Lil Artha remarked,
"don't you think now it would be a good thing to send
George down here?"</p>

<p>"That's an idea worth while," Elmer quickly replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, I get 'em once in a long time," grinned the other.</p>

<p>"A good scheme, and I'll send George back as soon as
I can. When he comes, take him in to see the woman.
Have him try and get her to understand that we mean
her men no harm, and only want them to set our chum free."</p>

<p>"And then what? Supposing George is able to get
that pounded into her head?" asked Lil Artha.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, he must make her understand that we want to
conduct an exchange of prisoners."</p>

<p>"By that, Elmer," Mark broke in, "I suppose you
mean well give the woman up if they let Nat go free?"</p>

<p>"That's it," returned the leader. "And as she is the
only one who knows their new hiding place, she must lead
us to them."</p>

<p>"That puts me wise, all right," declared Lil Artha.
"But get good old George here as soon as you can, Elmer.
I'm just crazy to see if he knows how to tell the old woman
all this."</p>

<p>"That's all, boys; I'll be going now."</p>

<p>But although Elmer said this he continued to stand
there immovable. Neither of his comrades thought it
strange, for they, too, had caught the same sound that had
reached his ears.</p>

<p>It was evidently a pretty good imitation of the howl of
a wolf.</p>

<p>Now, as this was the signal call of Elmer's own patrol
they knew immediately that some scout belonging to that
section of the Hickory Ridge troop must be approaching,
and took this customary method of announcing his
coming.</p>

<p>All eyes were accordingly turned toward that quarter
from whence the note of the wolf had seemed to come.</p>

<p>This was a little up the side of the mountain. Elmer,
thinking to give the other his location, sent out an answering
signal.</p>

<p>"You're scaring the old woman again with your howls,"
remarked Lil Artha, pointing to the shack, at the small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
window of which they could see the face of the prisoner,
filled with wonder and awe.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Italian woman was beginning to suspect
she had fallen into the hands of a pack of crazy people.</p>

<p>"There he comes!" suddenly announced Mark, pointing
as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Looks like Dr. Ted," remarked Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"Just who it is," said Elmer. "I wish it had been
George Robbins, now, because that would have saved time.
No such luck, it seems, so we'll just have to make the best
of it."</p>

<p>"But what d'ye suppose Ted's coming back after?"
pursued the tall scout.</p>

<p>"Help," declared Mark, decisively. "You heard what
Elmer said when he turned the troop over to Matty? If
they found themselves up a stump they were to let Elmer
know, just so he could swing in somehow, and pull them
out of the hole."</p>

<p>"They're up against it, good and hard, bet you a cooky
on it," declared Lil Artha, as the other scout drew near.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>THE NEED OF A PATHFINDER.</h3>


<p>As Dr. Ted approached he made the scout salute in due
regulation style.</p>

<p>"You're wanted above, thir," he said to the acting
scout master.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>"By that I suppose you mean they've struck a snag?"
questioned Elmer.</p>

<p>"The rockth bothered Matty. Tho long ath they left a
trail in the earth he could follow it all right. But when
it kept on athending it got tougher and tougher. Then
he lotht it altogether, and thent me to fetch you along,
thir."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll go with you, Number Three. You'll be
interested to know that we've got a prisoner here in the
old cabin," remarked Elmer.</p>

<p>Ted glanced that way, and caught sight of the face in
the window.</p>

<p>"The old Italian woman, eh?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Sure," said Lil Artha, as proudly as though the honors
of the capture belonged exclusively to him.</p>

<p>"Then she did come back for her beadth?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Tell you all about it on the way, for we must
be moving now, Ted," the scout master remarked.</p>

<p>"All right. I'm with you, Elmer. Come on, then," and,
wheeling sharply around, Ted started to retrace his steps.</p>

<p>So Mark and his long-legged comrade were left to guard
the prison of the old Italian woman, while the other two
scouts climbed the hill.</p>

<p>"No uthe going over the trail we made," remarked Ted.
"It wound around and then climbth the hill. We could
thee about where the cabin lay, and I made a bee line downhill
for the thame."</p>

<p>As they toiled upward Elmer, keeping his promise, related
all that had happened in the neighborhood of the
hidden shack.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Ted seemed to enjoy the narrative very much indeed.
He was particularly pleased with the account of where the
old woman in her panic had burst the door open, and upset
both Mark and Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"I wondered what happened to our friendth," said Ted.
"And if you hadn't been in thuch a big hurry to cut out,
I'd have tried fixing both the poor fellowth up. Lil
Artha lookth like a pirate chief, and ath for Mark, you'd
think hith brains might be breaking out."</p>

<p>Elmer had no trouble at all in following the plain trail
left by Ted when he came down from above. His practiced
eye could easily see the marks on turf, leaf mold, or
even where the other's heels with their steel nails had
scraped along a slanting rock.</p>

<p>"Tell me thome more about that, pleath," said Ted,
while they were still climbing.</p>

<p>Nothing loath, for he really believed he had solved the
secret of the whole business, Elmer gave him the story,
from his first faint suspicion upon looking down into the
strange-smelling cellar of the mill house, up to his detecting
such a strong odor of fish about the Italian woman,
and particularly the knife she carried.</p>

<p>"That'th a bully good idea, all right," said Ted, when
the story was finished.</p>

<p>"Do you think it sounds fishy?" laughed Elmer.</p>

<p>"Yeth and no," answered the other, immediately.
"While it theemth to be a fish yarn, yet it ith all to the
good. I really believe you've gone and figured it out,
Elmer. And if that ith tho, it ith going to be another big
feather in your cap, don't you forget it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"We ought to be close to where you left the rest of the
boys, by now," suggested the scout master, desirous of
changing the conversation, for, strange to say, Elmer never
liked to hear himself praised.</p>

<p>"I reckon we are," replied Ted. "Suppothe you try
your whistle, and give 'em a call."</p>

<p>So the patrol leader's whistle was brought into play
again. Hardly had it sounded than there came an answer
from a point not far distant.</p>

<p>"There they are!" cried Ted, pointing, "I thee Red
waving hith hat to uth right now. We'll join 'em in a jiffy,
if the walking ith good."</p>

<p>It proved to be decent enough for the two climbers to
reach the spot where Matty and the rest of the troop awaited
them.</p>

<p>"I'm all in, Elmer," admitted the leader of the Beaver
Patrol, as he threw up both hands in disgust. "Just as
I said, it was all hunk till I struck the rocks, and I've been
up in the air ever since."</p>

<p>"Yes, Matty has even hinted that he believes those Italians
must have had wings somewhere around here, and just
flown away," laughed Chatz.</p>

<p>"Well, that wouldn't be so very queer," declared Toby
Jones, always thinking of things touching on aviation.
"It's a bully good place to make a start, anyway, if a
feller only had the wings."</p>

<p>"Yes, and a gay old place to bring up on all the rocks
down there. And how about our chum Nat; he never had
any longing to soar through the air. But tell us what's
doing, Elmer," said Red, impatiently.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, he's got lots to tell you," declared Ted, with the
air of a highly favored one who had been already taken
into the great secret.</p>

<p>Of course his words stirred the scouts as nothing else
could have done. They crowded around and began to beg
for particulars.</p>

<p>"Where's Lil Artha?" one questioned.</p>

<p>"And Mark?" exclaimed another.</p>

<p>"Say, Elmer, did she come back, and step into the nice
little trap you were going to get ready?" asked a third
scout, with intense interest aroused.</p>

<p>When Elmer nodded his head they broke out into a rousing
boyish cheer.</p>

<p>"Tell us all about it, Elmer," was flung at the scout
master from all quarters.</p>

<p>As this was Elmer's intention anyway he lost no time
in briefly though forcibly describing all that had taken
place down below.</p>

<p>"And now I want George to go down with Ted, here,"
Elmer went on, "and try to engage the woman in conversation.
Tell her, if you can, who and what we are, and the
reason for our coming here in uniform. Tell her we mean
them no harm, but that we want our chum set free. Do you
follow me, George?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do," came the ready answer.</p>

<p>"You understand Italian, and talk it some, I've been
told?" Elmer went on.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I can really converse with some Italian men.
Don't know about a woman, though. But I'll do my best
to make her see things straight."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"I like to hear you talk that way, George," continued
Elmer; "the true scout is always ready to do his best.
And I think you're going to make a fine addition to our
troop before long."</p>

<p>"After I've told her, what then?" asked George, who
looked pleased at hearing these words of praise from one
he respected as highly as he did Elmer.</p>

<p>"Why, you must bring her along, and rejoin us. Lil
Artha and Mark will accompany you, because all ought to
be in at the finish. You understand, don't you, George?"</p>

<p>"I sure do. Come on, Ted, show me the way down to
the old shack. As we go along I'll be brushing up my
Italian words so as to spring 'em on the old lady. This
way, Ted."</p>

<p>"And while you're jabbering with the woman, why, perhaps
now I might be amuthing mythelf doctoring the
noble woundth of our two chumth," declared the fellow who
was never so happy as when engaged in the work of a
doctor.</p>

<p>Why, some of the boys often called Ted "Sawbones,"
because he gave himself over, heart and soul, to his one
great hobby.</p>

<p>So the two of them vanished down the side of the hill.
As their voices died away among the thickets Elmer turned
his attention to the task of finding and following the trail
of the Italians.</p>

<p>"Show me where you saw it last, Matty," he said.</p>

<p>"Here you are, then," came the reply; "that footprint
is as plain as anything."</p>

<p>"So it is," remarked Elmer, after studying the mark
briefly. "Our chum made that, I'm positive."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then he must have done it on purpose," said Matty,
"because I've noticed that one footprint right along."</p>

<p>Elmer smiled.</p>

<p>"Good for Nat," he remarked. "If he don't dare use
his voice and call out to us, he's doing everything in his
power to show us the trail. That's what he's learned of
scouting tactics. I'm glad he remembered. It shows how
much a fellow can learn."</p>

<p>"That's right," remarked Matty; "I see it all plain
enough right now; but d'ye know the suspicion never did
break in on me that these tracks had been made purposely,
and by Nat? Why, I just had an idea one of the bunch
was a little careless, that's all."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll know better after this, Matty. But stand
back, and let's see what luck I'll have, if so be you fellows
haven't killed the trail by running around."</p>

<p>They watched his actions eagerly, each fellow bent on
learning all he could of the science that was already proving
to be so interesting.</p>

<p>First of all Elmer took a comprehensive survey of the
ground above; for everyone understood that those they
were tracking must be aiming to reach some cave or crevice
farther up the slope.</p>

<p>Then, having settled in his mind about where the fugitives
might be aiming for, the scout master began to look
for marks on the rocks.</p>

<p>For a little while he found it very hard work, indeed, but
after reaching the limits of the search maintained by Matty
and those with him, the task became considerably easier.</p>

<p>And mindful of his position as acting scout master to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
troop during the temporary absence of Mr. Garrabrant,
Elmer made it a point to explain more or less as he went
along.</p>

<p>"See, here is where one of the men slipped on this rock,
and left a new scratch. And this shows where another
broke a twig off this branch in passing. You can see it
has been freshly done, because the green leaves do not show
much sign of wilting."</p>

<p>In this fashion, then, he not only intensely interested his
followers, but continued to make progress all the while.</p>

<p>Most of the boys were eager to get points on such an
engaging subject as trail finding. These hung upon his
every word, examined the marks to which Elmer drew their
attention, commented upon the same among themselves, and
several even went so far as to take out memorandum books
in which they hastily scribbled such notes as would enable
them to remember.</p>

<p>All the while they were climbing higher, and by degrees
found themselves in a wilder section than any of them had
dreamed existed so near their home town of Hickory Ridge.</p>

<p>"Looks like there might be a few caves around such a
place as this," remarked Red, as he wiped his face with
the red bandana handkerchief which he had hung cowboy
fashion around his neck, with the knot at the back.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's a dead-sure thing," replied Ty, who happened
to be close at his elbow at the time. "Fact is, I've
seen several myself. Anyhow, they were dark, ugly looking
holes between big rocks, and if this was a game country
I'd say they might be bear dens or the homes of wolves."</p>

<p>All this sort of talk tended to key the anticipations of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the boys up to a point where they were expecting almost
anything to happen.</p>

<p>Elmer paid no attention to side issues. There might be
a dozen likely looking hiding places along the route, but
they did not interest him an iota so long as that faintly
marked trail continued.</p>

<p>He had about all he cared to do, moving from one spot
where a stone had been freshly dislodged to another point
at which the moss and lichen had been torn from a sloping
rock by a foot that accidentally or purposely slipped.</p>

<p>There were possibly some little indications, which to his
mind told that they might now be drawing near the place
where the panic-stricken Italians were hiding. If so, Elmer
did not confide this to his companions, perhaps because he
might not himself be so very sure, but more probably on
account of not wishing to waste more or less precious time
in explaining on what vague grounds he founded his theory.</p>

<p>The trees still grew around them, springing out of spaces
between the rocks. They were more stunted than those
in the great forest that covered the richer bottom lands,
but as a rule they served as a canopy overhead, and only
occasional glimpses could be obtained of the country beyond.</p>

<p>By this time some of the scouts had begun to feel the
effect of the climb, for there is nothing more fatiguing than
ascending a steep hill.</p>

<p>Still they proved their grit by keeping on, as if determined
to stick it out.</p>

<p>Even fat Landy Smith, while actually panting for breath,
and mopping his forehead with a damp handkerchief, stubbornly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
declined to own himself in the "has been" class,
as Red called it.</p>

<p>They were moving along what seemed to be a little
plateau, at the end of which arose a cliff seamed with numerous
cracks and scars.</p>

<p>Elmer had smiled when he cast a glance toward the rocky
wall, just as if he could scent the end of the trail close
at hand.</p>

<p>But he was already halfway across the level territory,
with the scouts scattered back of him, when without the
least warning there suddenly sounded a shot that seemed
to come from somewhere ahead; and the report gave each
scout a strange chill in the region of his heart.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>RESCUED&mdash;CONCLUSION.</h3>


<p>"Scatter, and hide!"</p>

<p>It was Elmer who shouted this order. He had not heard
any sound as of a bullet passing, and did not know but
that the shot had been fired simply for the purpose of a
warning.</p>

<p>Still, there was no need of their taking chances. And
as he gave the command, Elmer was one of the first to seek
the shelter of a near-by rock.</p>

<p>Immediately the valiant scouts scurried around, each
eagerly desirous of finding some sort of snug retreat.</p>

<p>No further shots came, much to the satisfaction of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
boys, and inside of half a minute not a figure was to be
seen upon the little plateau.</p>

<p>It chanced that Red had selected the same rock as Elmer
picked out, behind which to crouch.</p>

<p>And of course Red could not long remain silent, since
his overcharged feelings just had to find a vent.</p>

<p>"Whew, this is what I call warm!" he said, puffing.</p>

<p>"Do you mean the weather, or the fact that we have been
under fire?" asked Elmer, who was looking out from
his end of the rock, and trying to size the situation up.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I guess both of 'em would pass muster, all
right," Red went on. "You don't think any fellow got
hurt, do you, Elmer?"</p>

<p>"Not any. Fact is," continued the scout master, "I've
a pretty good hunch the shot was not fired at us, but into
the air, warning us to keep off or we might get hurt."</p>

<p>"The ginnies fired it, of course, Elmer?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure of that."</p>

<p>"And we've cornered the bunch at last, hey? You
did the trick, Elmer. Trust you for following even half a
trail blindfolded. But say, do you know where they're
holding the fort?"</p>

<p>"I've got something of an idea," replied Elmer. "If
you look up the face of the cliff, Red, you'll notice a bunch
of green stuff growing. I think there must be a shelf of
rock there, and perhaps a cave back of it."</p>

<p>"But what makes you think that, Elmer?"</p>

<p>"Because I saw the powder smoke puff out from those
little bushes when the report sounded," replied Elmer.</p>

<p>"But my stars! that's all of fifty feet up. How d'ye<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
suppose those dagoes could get up there?" continued the
one who sought information.</p>

<p>"Oh, that would just as likely as not turn out to be
easy enough, once you got started. Perhaps there's some
sort of path leading up the face of the cliff, and which we
just can't see from here."</p>

<p>"What're we going to do, Elmer?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;just now, anyway."</p>

<p>"Just sit on our haunches, and wait for our birds to
drop into our hands, eh?" pursued Red.</p>

<p>"Oh, perhaps we may have to fight for it in the end, but
I'm hoping for an easier wind up to the affair," Elmer continued,
musingly.</p>

<p>"You think the old woman may help out?"</p>

<p>"I know she will, if George can only succeed in convincing
her that we're friends, not enemies."</p>

<p>"Then we're waiting till they arrive?" asked Red.</p>

<p>"I'm going to give the signal for retiring as soon as
the boys get their breath back," remarked the scout master.</p>

<p>"Well, they might be in better places, because the sun
feels scorching to me right now," grumbled Red.</p>

<p>"Then pick out your new roost, and be ready to migrate
as soon as you hear the whistle. Pass the word along, too,
Red."</p>

<p>Presently it was understood that when the scout master
gave the signal every fellow was expected to crawl or dart
away, seeking through one way or another to get out of
the fire zone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope George has succeeded in explaining everything
to the woman by now," remarked Red.</p>

<p>"I'm sure he has, and that the whole of them are even
now on the way here to wind up this business," Elmer declared
most confidently.</p>

<p>When ten minutes had gone by, and he felt sure that
all of the scouts knew what they were expected to do, Elmer
took out his whistle.</p>

<p>Then the shrill notes sounded, cutting the air as though
charged with irresistible force.</p>

<p>Immediately everybody got busy. Khaki-clad figures
could be seen darting this way and that, but none of them
made any attempt to advance. This sort of move might be
expected to anger the Italians, without doing any good, and
the scouts had been warned against it.</p>

<p>There came no second discharge of firearms, and from
this fact it seemed evident that the unseen enemy understood
that there was nothing hostile connected with this
action on the part of the scouts.</p>

<p>Again did Red and Elmer find themselves good neighbors
as they arrived at a pile of rocks, behind which they
sought shelter.</p>

<p>"All safe?" asked the former.</p>

<p>"Yes, as far as I know," came the answer. "Landy fell
all over himself, and started to roll downhill, but one
of the other fellows pulled him up. He was limping to
beat the band, but I hope it's nothing serious."</p>

<p>"No danger," chuckled Red. "Landy is too well padded
to suffer much from a fall. Now do we just wait
here till the others fetch the lady?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's a part of the contract," said Elmer; "so just
make yourself as comfy as you can."</p>

<p>"And watch the big rock there, eh, Elmer?"</p>

<p>"Oh, if you want. We would feel pretty cheap if they
took a sly sneak, and left us in the lurch."</p>

<p>Elmer settled down as though he thought there was no
use borrowing trouble. And seeing their leader take things
in such a matter-of-fact way the balance of the scouts followed
suit.</p>

<p>Confidence thus begets confidence in others; and this in
itself was one of Elmer's reasons for acting as he did.</p>

<p>The minutes passed.</p>

<p>Several times did impatient Red get up on his knees to
take a look down the hill.</p>

<p>"Shucks! but they're a long time coming," he mumbled.
"Perhaps, after all, the old woman was too sharp for the
bunch&mdash;perhaps she's tucked 'em away in the cabin&mdash;turning
the tables on our four chums&mdash;perhaps, now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Right there Red stopped in his predictions of evil.</p>

<p>"There they come," said Elmer, quietly.</p>

<p>One hasty look satisfied Red that his comrade spoke only
the truth. Moving figures caught his eye just a little way
down the slope.</p>

<p>These presently developed into four boys, three of whom
were clad in khaki. The other, who was, of course, George,
the interpreter, kept close at the side of the Italian woman.</p>

<p>Now and then she seemed to address some remark to
George, which he doubtless answered to the best of his
ability. When his vocabulary proved unequal to the task<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
he would finish with a series of gestures and shrugs as he
had seen chattering Italians do.</p>

<p>And presently they reached the spot where the balance
of the scouts held forth.</p>

<p>The woman surveyed them as she came up, but Elmer
noticed that she did not seem afraid now.</p>

<p>"I guess you've done the business, George," he remarked
to the new recruit.</p>

<p>"Well," replied the other, with a broad grin, "that's
what I think myself, Elmer."</p>

<p>"She understands now who we are, and that we haven't
any intention of doing her men any harm&mdash;you explained
all that?"</p>

<p>"Sure. And you can see now that instead of looking
scared, she's ready to grin if you give her any encouragement,"
replied George.</p>

<p>"And she knows that we want her to go out with us
and have a talk with her old man, telling him what a fool
he's been making of himself. She understands all that,
does she?"</p>

<p>"Like a book, and is ready to do the trick. We'll have
our Nat back in short order, now," George continued, looking
proud and happy because he had been able to prove
of such valuable assistance to his fellow scouts, even before
he got his uniform.</p>

<p>"All right, then. The sooner we start the ball rolling
the better. Come along, George."</p>

<p>Presently the two of them were escorting the Italian
woman toward the foot of the cliff.</p>

<p>When two thirds of the way there an angry, excitable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
voice stopped them. On looking up they could see several
heads topping the sparse vegetation that undoubtedly grew
along a ledge.</p>

<p>"Now, tell her to talk, George!" said Elmer.</p>

<p>There was hardly any need, for the woman had broken
loose on her own account. And such chattering as followed&mdash;Lil
Artha afterward declared it reminded him of
a monkey cage when one of the inmates had taken more
than his share of the dinner provided.</p>

<p>But the woman did most of the talking. She also scolded,
stamped her foot, and even shook her fist up at those above.</p>

<p>Evidently her arguments must have had a convincing
ring about them, for suddenly she turned to George and
smiled amiably as she said something, and made a suggestive
movement of both shoulders.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Elmer," declared George.</p>

<p>"Are they going to do what we want?" asked the scout
master, greatly pleased.</p>

<p>"Sure. And I reckon there he comes now. One of the
men seems to be helping Nat down the path that runs along
the face of the rock. Bully! We win out!"</p>

<p>A loud cheer from the scouts told how they were enjoying
the situation.</p>

<p>Nat Scott waved his hand to them in greeting, for, having
lost his hat at the shack, he was bareheaded.</p>

<p>The Italian was still a little suspicious, for he would come
only two thirds of the way down. But Nat easily made the
balance, and was soon shaking hands with everyone of
his mates, just as though he had been separated from them
for a week.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving the woman to rejoin her people the scouts made
their way down the side of the mountain until they reached
the mill pond.</p>

<p>Nat's story was brief, and just about what Elmer had
guessed. In prowling around he had unexpectedly come
upon the three men.</p>

<p>They had seized upon him and threatened him with their
knives if he so much as gave a yell. He had been kept for
a short time in the shack. Then Landy's prowling around
seemed to fill the Italians with a new alarm, and the three
men, together with the woman, had hastily fled.</p>

<p>On the way up the mountain the woman had discovered
the loss of something, and gone back.</p>

<p>Then the men forced him to hurry along, and finally
landed him on that secret ledge where he believed there
was some sort of cave.</p>

<p>That was all Nat knew, and the whole thing smacked
strongly of mystery until he heard what Elmer's theory was.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," Nat said, with considerable satisfaction in
his voice and manner, "they didn't scare me one little
bit. And besides, Elmer, in lots of places I went and made
plain marks that I just knew you could read any old time."</p>

<p>"That stamps you a true-blue scout, Nat," declared
Elmer, "and I think the troop has reason to be proud of
you."</p>

<p>"Three cheers for Comrade Nat Scott," suggested impulsive
Red; and they were given with such a vim that many
of the big bullfrogs along the farther bank jumped into
the mill pond in great alarm.</p>

<p>As their main object had been carried out while on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
way to the haunted mill, and there was no further reason
for lingering after they had eaten the "snack" carried
along for this purpose, the Hickory Ridge troop of scouts
took up the homeward march.</p>

<p>After talking it all over among themselves it was decided
that their duty compelled them to give the game and fish
warden a hint as to what was probably going on up at
Munsey's mill.</p>

<p>He went there with a deputy two days later, but the
Italians had taken warning and fled. However, the warden
found and destroyed several nets with which the fish poachers
had been illegally gathering the finny prizes in the
long-deserted pond.</p>

<p>There was one disappointed scout in the troop however,
and this was Chatz Maxfield.</p>

<p>He always would feel as though he had missed the opportunity
of his life in spending some time at a haunted
mill which was supposed to support a good lively ghost,
and never once chancing to come upon the hobgoblin.</p>

<p>However, Chatz would continue to live in hope.</p>

<p>At any rate, everyone was positive that he had learned
a host of valuable things calculated to make him take
higher rank as a woodsman, and a true scout. And no
doubt in the annals of the Hickory Ridge Boy Scouts that
little hike to Munsey's mill would always be read and re-read
with the keenest interest, and take rank with the
greatest of their achievements.</p>

<h2>THE REPTILES OF THE UNITED STATES.</h2>


<p>The reptiles are a class of vertebrate animals. By vertebrate
animals is meant those having a backbone. Reptiles
are cold-blooded animals having scaly skins, and breathing
by lungs and not by gills as do the fish. Strange as it may
seem they are related to the birds. In prehistoric times they
were of enormous size and many of them were capable of
flying. Fossil forms of reptiles are very numerous and
scientists have given these fossil forms such sonorous names
as Dinosaurs, Ichthyosaurs, Plesiosaurs and Pterosaurs.
These names are made up of Greek words meaning terrible
lizards, fish lizards, near lizards and winged lizards.</p>

<p>The class of reptiles is made up of five orders:</p>

<p class="outof">
Sphenodons;<br />
Lacertilia;<br />
Ophidia;<br />
Chelonia;<br />
Crocodilia.</p>

<p>Of the Sphenodons, there is but one living representative.
Its home is in New Zealand. Zoologists tell us that
this reptile is more closely related to its fossil cousins than
any other now in existence. Since we are considering only
those reptiles which an American boy may find living in
their natural haunts in his home land, discussion of the
Sphenodon is out of place in this article. We recommend,
however, that you read up about this curious creature that
links the gigantic prehistoric lizards with the little creatures
of to-day's world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE LACERTILIA OR LIZARDS.</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 504px;">
<img src="images/006.png" width="504" height="550" alt="" title="" />
LIZARDS.<br /><br />1. ZEBRA-TAILED LIZARD.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2. PACIFIC SWIFT.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3. COLLARED LIZARD.<br />
4. WHITE-BELLIED SWIFT.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
5. COMMON SWIFT OR FENCE LIZARD.</div>

<p>Lizards differ from snakes in that the right and left
halves of the lower jaw are joined together by bone instead
of elastic ligament and in that they have legs and eyelids.
They are found in the warmer climates. Most of them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
live on insects, but some types as, for instance, the Iguanas,
live entirely on vegetable matter, while others prey on
birds, mice, frogs, etc.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Geckos.</p>

<p>The Geckos form a large sub-order of lizards. Their
chief characteristic is their adhesive toes, which enable
them to cling to and run on smoothest surfaces even when
upside down. They do not like the hot sunlight and largely
feed at twilight and at night. The Reef Gecko is found
in Florida; the Warty Gecko, so called on account of the
rows of large wart-like scales on its back and sides, inhabits
Lower California; the Cape Gecko, Lower California;
the Banded Gecko, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona
and California. The latter is the most gaudily marked
of the Geckos found in the United States and is likewise
the most abundant. It may be seen at dusk coming out
of rock crevices to feed on small insects. Many consider
this lizard poisonous and its saliva is supposed to produce
painful skin eruptions. Authorities, however, tell us
that this is not so. The first three Geckos mentioned live
largely in trees, but the Banded Gecko lives on or near
the ground.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Chameleons.</p>

<p>The American Chameleons are not true chameleons, but
belong to the same family as the Iguana. They have come
to be known as Chameleons because, like the rightful
owners of that name, they change the color of their bodies.
This change is occasioned by the differences of temperature
and light. One species is found in the United States
and is known under various names, such as the green
lizard, the fence lizard and the alligator lizard. It is called
alligator lizard from its resemblance to a young alligator.
This lizard is found in the southeastern United States
from North Carolina to Florida. The common colors of
the American Chameleon or the Anolis, which is its scientific<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
name, are brown and green. These colors vary with
conditions. When asleep, for instance, this little reptile
is green above and white below, and when fighting or
frightened it becomes green; at other times it is brown.
Raymond L. Ditmars, Curator of Reptiles in the New
York Zoological Park, says that in collecting these lizards
and placing them in wire-covered boxes, he has "always
noted their change from various hues, prior to capture,
to a scrambling collection of several dozen emerald-green
lizards. If the gauze cage be laid down for half an hour
or so while the collector rests, the lizards soon take on a
brownish tinge, but as soon as the box is again carried
about and the occupants are shaken up and frightened,
the brilliant color appears among them all." He further
says that "there is no relation or influence between the
lizard's colors and its surroundings. The change of color
is brought about principally through temperature and light
and their influences on the creature's activity; also by
anger, fear and sleep."</p>

<p>The Anolis stalks its prey like a cat does a mouse. It
crouches and creeps forward for the final spring with
motions that are exactly similar. It lives in trees and feeds
upon insects. These little creatures make interesting pets
and will soon learn to take their food from your hand. The
proper quarters for it is a wire-covered fernery which
should be placed in a warm but moist situation and the
foliage daily sprinkled with water. The Anolis is a great
water drinker and will find the drops adhering to the
leaves of the plants.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Iguanas.</p>

<p>There are but few species of Iguanas found in the United
States and these only in the southwestern part. They are
large in size and have a crest of spiny scales running along
the neck and back. They use their tails as weapons of
offense and defense. The Cape Iguana is a species found
only in Lower California. The tail is ringed with large
spines. The Black Iguana is found in southern Arizona.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
It is a great fighter when at bay and is then no mean
antagonist. It does not invite a fight, however, but will
run if there is any chance of escape. Both of these Iguanas
reach about four feet in length. They have large appetites
and eat both animal and vegetable matter&mdash;birds,
small animals and tender vegetation. In central and southern
America their flesh is prized as a food and it is said
to have the flavor of chicken. They live part of the time
in trees and part of the time on the ground. The Desert
Iguana, however, is terrestrial. It is found in the desert
parts of the southwestern United States&mdash;in Colorado, California,
Arizona and Nevada. It is largely vegetarian. The
tail is brittle, and to free itself when held by it, this creature
will easily and readily snap it off.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

IGUANA.</div>




<p class="hd5">The Chuckawalla.</p>

<p>There is only one of these that is fairly common in the
United States and that is found in the deserts of the
southwest. It is the largest lizard found there except the
Gila Monster which will be described later. The body of
the Chuckawalla is broad and the legs short. Its length
averages about a foot. It lives mostly among the rocks of
the deserts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>


<p class="hd5">The Collared Lizard.</p>

<p>This lizard is so called on account of the markings of
the neck, which have the appearance of a double black
collar. The throat is an orange color. It is one of the
most gayly colored of the small lizards. It is quite common
in the dry and stony parts of the western states and
in western Texas is very abundant. It is a great eater
and is not afraid to fight for its dinner. One peculiarity
of this lizard is its ability to run on its hind legs. It will
gulp and bolt food as large as itself.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Leopard Lizard.</p>

<p>In color it is yellow, spotted with dark spots and lined
across the back with dull red lines. Its habitat includes
Oregon, California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and
Texas.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Zebra-tailed Lizards.</p>

<p>These are small ground lizards found from Texas to
California, especially in the dry sections. They run with
great rapidity with the tail curved upward, which exposes
the markings of the lower surface. Frequently they run
like the Collared Lizard, on the hind feet. The black-and-white
tail markings account for their name.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Spotted Lizards.</p>

<p>These are small ground lizards found in many states
from Kansas to California and southward. They are very
quick in their movements. Their food consists of insects
of the more sluggish type. They do not stalk their prey
like the chameleons.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>


<p class="hd5">The Swifts.</p>

<p>There are a great many species of these small lizards in
the United States. They live on the ground among rocks in
dry places and are called swifts on account of the speed
with which they are able to get over the ground. Some
of them are covered with spiny scales. Clark's Swift is
abundant in certain parts of the country. It is found in
California, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah. It is fond
of the strongest sunlight. The Yellow Striped Swift is
found from Texas to Nebraska on the north, into Mexico
on the south and California on the west.</p>

<p>The Common Swift is found abundantly both in the
eastern and in the western United States. They like dry,
sandy places among fallen trees, fences, old wood, etc. In
color they are gray and are usually in harmony with their
surroundings.</p>

<p>The Collared Swift lives among rocks in Arizona, New
Mexico and Texas. It has a black collar with very sharp
spiny scales.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Horned Lizard.</p>

<p>These lizards are commonly called Horned Toads, because
of their resemblance in the shape of their bodies to that of a
toad and of their spiny scales which have the appearance
of small horns. Their habitat is in the hottest and driest
parts of the country. They are fond of the hottest sunlight
and bury themselves in sand at the approach of
evening.</p>

<p>The Regal Horned Lizard is found in Arizona and Colorado.</p>

<p>The California Horned Lizard is found abundantly in
sections of California.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 515px;">

HORNED TOAD.</div>




<p class="hd5">The Snake-like Lizards.</p>

<p>These lizards have elongated bodies with either small
limbs or no external evidence of such. Some cannot be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
easily distinguished from snakes. On close examination it
will be seen that there is a ridge along each side of the
body.</p>

<p>The Keeled Lizard has a habit of keeping its tongue protruded
and will wipe its lips with it after feeding. Its
tail is easily separated from its body and when so separated,
the broken off portion wriggles violently. New tails
grow on. It is found in California, Oregon, Washington
and eastward from California to Texas.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>The "Glass-Snake" has no limbs and to the eye of anyone
but a naturalist would easily be mistaken for a snake.
What distinguishes it from a snake is the presence of eyelids
and ear holes. It occurs in many localities. It is
common from the Carolinas to Florida and as far north
as Illinois. Like the Keeled Lizard it has the ability to
shed a very lively, wriggling tail. It feeds on worms and
slugs that it finds by burrowing and will occasionally
break and eat the eggs of ground-nesting birds.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Beaded Lizards.</p>

<p>This is a family of large lizards whose bodies look as
if covered with beads. They are held to be poisonous by
well-known authorities and are the only poisonous lizards
found in the states.</p>

<p>The Gila Monster (pronounced Hee-la) has a thick body
with short limbs and a short tail. In color it is pink and
black. Its length is about a foot and a half. It is found
in New Mexico and Arizona and is named after the river
Gila, the valley of which it inhabits. The creature will
defend itself viciously and will hold on tenaciously with
its strong jaws. The eggs are buried in the sand.</p>


<p class="hd5">Xanthus Lizards.</p>

<p>Small lizards that are found where the tree yuccas grow.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Race Runners.</p>

<p>These are easily distinguished by the yellow stripes on
their bodies. They are to be found in the dry, sandy portions
of the western states, burrowing in the sand and when
pursued taking refuge in these burrows.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Worm Lizards.</p>

<p>These are a low grade of lizards that live underground
like worms. The Worm Lizard, found in Florida, is scarcely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
any larger around than an earthworm. It is able to move
backward or forward in the earth, the end of the tail being
shaped similar to the head.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Skinks.</p>

<p>This is a large family. They are burrowing lizards. The
Red Headed Lizard is widely distributed throughout the
United States. It is very timid and extremely difficult to
capture. Its color changes with its age. The Black Banded
Skink is found in the central portions of the United States.
The Florida Skink in southern Florida. The Black Skink
from Pennsylvania southward to Texas.</p>

<p>Here we reach the end of the order of reptiles known as
lizards; the next order is that of the snakes.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE OPHIDIA OR SNAKES.</h2>


<p>Snakes are closely related to lizards. Some lizards, as you
have already seen, are very much like snakes in form. The
main distinguishing features of the snake are the elastic tissue
which connects the two halves of the lower jaw and the
absence of eyelids. Snakes are carnivorous and are capable
of moving with great ease and swiftness notwithstanding
their lack of limbs. They cast their skins several times
a year. Many of the snakes are poisonous, and authorities
tell us that there is no external characteristic that indicates
which are poisonous and which are not.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Blind Snakes.</p>

<p>This is a low form of snake. They are worm-like and
burrowing. The Texas Blind Snake is found in Texas and
New Mexico. The California Blind Snake in California
and Mexico.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Boas.</p>

<p>The most common member of this family that comes
within the range of this article is a snake that is found
in the Pacific states and eastward as far as Nevada. It
is over a foot in length and about half an inch in diameter.
Various names have been given to it; in certain sections
it is called the Rubber Boa, in others the Silver Snake,
Two-headed Snake, Worm Snake. The name Two-headed
Snake is given it evidently on account of the stubby appearance
of the tail end.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Ribbon Snakes.</p>

<p>These snakes have a yellow stripe along the back and the
sides. They are long, slim snakes; specimens have been seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
that measured nearly three feet long, although the average
length is about two feet. It is found east of the Mississippi,
but is not common. It frequents the banks of water
to feed on young frogs and so forth. They swim well and
are at home in the water. In the Western Ribbon Snake
the back stripe is darker than those on the side, or in some
instances a different color.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Garter Snakes.</p>

<p>These are found all over the United States and are perfectly
harmless. They are abundant. Burrowing in the
ground in the late fall they remain there all winter. Even
the boy living in the large cities may, without going out
of the city limits, find these snakes. They are quite commonly
found in large public parks. They like frogs and
toads and bolt their food. There are many varieties of this
snake. Both the Ribbon Snakes and the Garter Snakes belong
to the genus Eut&aelig;nia, which is the most numerous
of those of the United States. They are all striped snakes
and are very much like the water snakes in structure.
There is no easily distinguished characteristic that would
enable a boy, at a glance, to tell a Garter Snake. They
vary widely in color and marking.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Water Snakes.</p>

<p>Here is another genus of snakes that is found commonly
in many sections of our country. They frequent the vicinity
of water and swim with ease, feeding on frogs, toads,
fish. The Queen Snake is found generally east of the
Mississippi Valley. It is brown above and has yellow
stripes on the side. The Banded Water Snake is the water
snake which is commonly found in the southern part of
the United States east of Texas. It closely resembles the
Moccasin, a poisonous snake, and is often mistaken for it.
It attains an average length of over a yard. When alarmed,
like all the water snakes, it takes to the water for refuge.
This genus never preys on birds or mice. It is one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
most common of the southern snakes. The Red-bellied
Water Snake is found in the east, but not north of Virginia.
The Common Water Snake is the northern representative
of this genus. These snakes are popularly known
as "Moccasins." The Diamond Back Water Snake is common
along the lower Mississippi states. They average four
feet in length. May be seen on low branches overhanging
water. The Green Water Snake is similar in habit to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the Diamond Back and is found in the Gulf and the Mississippi
Valley states. One peculiarity of the water snakes
is their love of their home. They pick out a particular
sunning place and will return to it regularly.</p>

<p class="hd5">The Ground Snake or Brown Snake.</p>

<p>This is a common snake, found all over the United States
east of the Rocky Mountains. It is small in size, about a
foot long and slender, and hides under stones, where it
probably feeds on the worms and forms of insect life that
live in such places.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Racers.</p>

<p>The serpents of this type are very active and nervous.
The Gopher Snake, or Indigo Snake, is one of the largest
found in the United States. It has been known to measure
over eight feet in length. It is found from Texas eastward in
the Gulf states. Its scales have a polished appearance and
are blue black in color. It may be seen in sandy stretches.
When feeding it holds its prey down with part of its body.
It is not particular as to its diet and will eat birds with
the same relish as cold-blooded frogs and toads. In the
Central and South American countries this snake is highly
valued as a "ratter" and frequents human habitations
without fear. The Black Snake is abundant in the United
States. It has a bad reputation. It is said to be a fearless
fighter, not afraid to attack man even, and to be able to
"charm" its prey within its reach. These attributes are
popular beliefs without any basis of fact. It is fond of
small birds and field mice and is what may be called a
meadow snake. When frightened it speeds away at an
incredible rate. The Coachwhip Snake, found in the southeast,
is even more agile than the Black Snake, and like that
serpent, will eat smaller snakes. It gets its name from
its slender structure and similarity of the appearance of
its scale distribution to a plaited whip. The Striped Racer
of the southwestern states is very long and slender.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>


<p class="hd5">The Rat Snakes or Colubers.</p>

<p>These are large, strong snakes that squeeze and crush
their prey by coiling themselves around it. They are useful
to the farmer, as they inhabit grainfields and prey on
the rats and mice. An easy way to tell these snakes is by
their flat belly. The Fox Snake is quite common in the
Central states. It averages about four feet long. It derives
its name from an odor which it is able to eject,
which smells not unlike that of the fox. Often it will kill
and eat animals as large as rabbits. It deposits its eggs
in some natural hollow and leaves them there to hatch. A
snake that is abundant in the southeastern states is known
by the various names of Corn Snake, Red Chicken Snake,
Mouse Snake, Scarlet Racer and Red Coluber. It is red,
black and white. It is not as much of a climber as the
Racers are, nor is it as agile; but it is braver and will fight
when cornered. It is frequently found in cornfields, hence
its name. The Pilot Black Snake or Mountain Black Snake
is often taken for the Common Black Snake. Its head is
larger and it is spotted with white. It is a snake frequently
found in the same locations as the rattlesnake and copperhead.
The Chicken Snake is fond of eggs and young
chickens. Like the Fox Snake it will emit an unpleasant
odor when caught.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Bull Snakes.</p>

<p>The Pine or Bull Snake is one of the largest snakes
found in the east. It is found in the sandy pine woods
of the coast. When disturbed it is vicious in appearance,
hisses loudly and strikes vigorously. It feeds on small animals
and birds. It is also called the Gopher Snake. "The
Yellow Gopher" Snake is found in the middle and western
states.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Green Snakes.</p>

<p>The Green Whip Snake or Magnolia Snake is green above,
yellow below. It feeds on insects and is a good climber.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
In color it so perfectly matches the leaves and grass that
detection is difficult. The "Grass Snake" is a common
snake of the northeastern states.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Ring-necked Snakes.</p>

<p>The eastern Ring-necked Snake is found in the eastern
portion of the United States. It has a yellow ring about
the neck. This snake is not given to venturing abroad,
but prefers to lie under stones and the loose bark of trees.</p>


<p class="hd5">The King Snakes.</p>

<p>These snakes are remarkable for their colors. They are
banded around their bodies with rings of bright colors.
They will eat rats and mice and other snakes. The Milk
Snake or "Checkered Adder" is popularly supposed to
be fond of milk. Scientists tell us that this is a fallacy.
It feeds on mice, rats, other snakes and lizards. The Red
Milk Snake is prettily colored&mdash;red and yellow&mdash;and is the
type found in the south. All the King Snakes have pronounced
patterns. More than in any other genus is the
habit of feeding on its kind developed&mdash;attacking, and
usually successfully, snakes larger than themselves. It
is from this characteristic that they derive their name. It
is bitten by the poisonous snakes which it attacks but without
effect; the King Snake tightens its grip until its adversary
is lifeless.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Rainbow Snakes.</p>

<p>These are sometimes called the mud snakes, from the
fact that they are abundant in swamps. They burrow in
the mud. The Red-bellied Snake is also called the Rainbow
Snake, Mud Snake, Horn Snake and Hoop Snake.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Hog-nosed Snakes.</p>

<p>These snakes are fighters. The peculiar formation of the
mouth makes them easily distinguishable. They hiss when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
disturbed and flatten their heads and necks. They are
popularly known as "adders" and "vipers." They are
found in dry and sandy situations.</p>

<p>The common Hog-nosed Snake is found in dry, sandy
locations practically all through the United States except
on the Pacific slope. It has the peculiar habit of feigning
death when cornered. Before it tries these tactics it will
make a terrific show of ferocity. It is capable of flattening
its head and neck in a formidable manner and while
assuming this attitude it hisses sharply. If this show does
not scare away its enemy it will suddenly be seized with
a spasm, ending by turning on its back, limp and apparently
lifeless. When it thinks danger is past it recovers
its normal position and quickly gets away. This snake
is known popularly as the "Flat-headed Adder," the
"Puff Adder," "Viper" and "Blow Snake."</p>


<p class="hd5">The Harlequin or Coral Snake.</p>

<p>Is a strikingly marked serpent. Its colors are scarlet,
black and yellow. This snake is found in the southeastern
and central United States. It is a near relative to the deadly
Cobra-de-Capello and is itself poisonous. A burrowing
reptile.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Moccasins.</p>

<p>These snakes are highly poisonous. The Water Moccasin
is one of the largest venomous snakes found in the United
States. Some have been caught that measured four feet
in length and almost two and a half inches around. Certain
kinds of harmless water snakes are popularly supposed
to be and are called "moccasins." Unless you have
a very close knowledge of which is which, you should be
careful how near you approach them. The Water Moccasin
is found quite abundantly in the east from the Carolinas
southward and along the Mississippi states as far north as
Illinois. It likes swamps and is found abundantly in many
southern swampy sections. This snake is often known as
the "Cotton Mouth" Snake. It is vicious and pugnacious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
and will fight snakes of any size. The prey of this serpent
consists of birds, frogs, other snakes, fish and small animals.
The Copperhead derives its name from the copperish
tint on its head. It is not as large a snake as the
Water Moccasin, nor does it like the swamps. It frequents
rocky locations that are thickly wooded. It has a peculiar
habit of backing away from danger by looping its body
and then drawing it straight again.</p>

THE MOCCASIN.</div>

<p class="hd5">The Rattlesnakes.</p>

<p>The rattlesnake is the most interesting as well as the
most deadly of the North American serpents. Its chief
distinguishing characteristic is the rattle at the end of tail.
Curator Ditmars, of the New York Zoological Park, says
that although he has "studied living examples of many
species of deadly snakes&mdash;the South American bushmaster
and the fer-de-lance, the African puff adder and the berg
adder, and such East Indian species as the king cobra, the
spectacled cobra and Russell's viper, and although there
is indelibly stamped upon his mind the bloated body, the
glassy stare and the rhythmic hissing of the berg adder,
the rearing, uncanny pose of an infuriated cobra&mdash;there is
one image vivid above all, the rattlesnake. Thrown into
a gracefully symmetrical coil, the body inflated, the neck
arched in an oblique bow in support of the heart-shaped
head, the slowly waving tongue with spread and tremulous
tips, and above all, the incessant, monotonous whir of
the rattle. One stroke&mdash;a flash&mdash;of that flat head would
inject a virus bringing speedy death."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 502px;">
<img src="images/011.png" width="502" height="550" alt="" title="" />
RATTLESNAKE.</div>

<p>The rattlesnake always warns its enemy of its presence
by its rattle. Were it not for this habit there would probably
be many more deaths from the bites of this snake.
The snake does not add a new ring to its rattle each year,
as it is popularly supposed to do. The Massasauga is one
of the smaller rattlesnakes, averaging about two feet in
length. It inhabits swampy places. The Timber Rattlesnake
is found from Vermont to Florida and west to Kansas.
It is abundant in the mountains of New York, Massachusetts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and Pennsylvania. In the spring and fall the
snakes congregate on ledges of rocks; such places are called
"rattlesnake dens." They spend the winter in crevices
in these rocky places. The Timber Rattler is more timid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
than many of its cousins, preferring flight to combat, but
if cornered will fight as fiercely. It feeds on birds and
small animals. The largest rattlesnake is the Diamond-back.
Specimens have been caught that measured over
six feet long and four inches around. This snake is one
of the most deadly in the world. It is found most abundantly
in Florida. It is never known to strike uncoiled and
rarely retreats from danger. The food of this snake seems
to consist mostly of small animals. It takes but a minute
for the poison from the Diamond-back's fangs to kill a
rabbit.</p>

<h2>THE CHELONIA OR TURTLES AND TORTOISES.</h2>


<p>Turtles and tortoises belong to the order known as Chelonia.
There are Fresh-water Turtles, Sea Turtles and
Land Turtles.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Sea Turtles.</p>

<p>These turtles are often carried by storm far north of
their customary habitat, which is in the warmer waters of
the southeastern coast. The Leatherback, or Trunk Turtle,
is the largest of the sea turtles, sometimes reaching a weight
of half a ton. It is not found in abundance. The Loggerhead
Turtle has a very large head. Its eggs are buried
in the sand about May or June and the young turtles hatch
out in about two months' time. The Green Turtle often
strays into northern waters. The flesh of this turtle is prized
by epicures. It will die if not placed on its back, the under
shell being pressed by the weight of the upper shell against
its lungs, causing suffocation. The Hawksbill Turtle is
distinguished by the hawk-like appearance of its head. It
is the smallest of the sea turtles and the one from which
is obtained the sought-after tortoise shells.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>
<img src="images/012.png" width="700" height="492" alt="" title="" />
SEA TURTLE.</div>

<p class="hd5">The Snapping Turtles.</p>

<p>These are the largest of the fresh-water turtles. Like
the snakes they strike at their prey or their enemy, and their
sharp mandibles make them a formidable antagonist. They
will pull down their prey under the water where they always
feed. The Alligator Snapping Turtle is found in
the Gulf states. A peculiarity of this reptile is the fleshy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
filament, grub-like in appearance, which it has in its mouth
and which acts as a bait, attracting fish within the reach of
its powerful jaws.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Mud Turtles.</p>

<p>The Musk Turtle is a common type of the Mud Turtle and
is found in abundance in the muddy streams of the eastern,
part of the United States. It will often be taken on a fish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
hook. It derives its name from the odor it gives forth. Seldom
is it found out of the water. It snaps when taken in a
way which rivals the Snapping Turtle. The common Mud
Turtle is not as abundant as the Musk Turtle to which it is
similar in habit, crawling along the muddy bottoms of ponds
and rivers. The under shell of the Mud Turtles is much
broader than that of the Musk Turtles. The Banded Mud
Turtle, found in Georgia and Florida, has three yellow
stripes or "bands" on its shell. The Yellow-necked Mud
Turtle gets its name from its bright yellow neck.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Terrapins.</p>

<p>The Painted Terrapin or Pond Turtle is brightly colored.
The under shell is yellow and the upper shell is bordered
with mottled red. It is found in the eastern United States.
You may frequently see it taking a sunning on a partially
submerged log, diving into the water upon your approach.
It feeds on insects, small fishes and water weeds. In your
aquarium it will eat small pieces of beef, fish, worms or
tender greens. The Chicken Turtle or Long-necked Terrapin
is found in the southeastern states. The Yellow-bellied
Terrapin is found from Virginia to Georgia. It is one of
the terrapins that are sold in the markets. Many may be
seen there, especially in Charleston. The Cumberland Terrapin
may be known by the red marking on each side of its
head. This, too, is sold in the markets; it is found in the
middle western states. The Diamond Back Terrapin is the
most highly prized by epicures&mdash;seven-inch-long turtles
bringing as much as $5 or more apiece. It is found in the
marshes of the eastern and southeastern coast states. As
the size increases, the price advances. They are becoming
scarce. It always feeds under water. Grows to larger size
in the South. The Spotted Turtle is found in abundant
quantities in the eastern states. It has round yellow spots
scattered over its black upper shell and may be seen near
ponds, streams and marshy places. It is fond of water that
is grassy, hiding therein.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>


<p class="hd5">The Box Turtles.</p>

<p>This turtle is fitted with a complete suit of armor, into
which it can withdraw and become practically immune from
harm. It is not an aquatic reptile, its food consisting principally
of vegetation. It is fond of berries and is found
most abundantly in grassy thickets. It lives many years.
At the approach of winter it burrows into the ground.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 486px;">

BOX TURTLE.</div>

<p class="hd5">The Tortoises.</p>

<p>The Tortoises live only on the land. The Gopher Tortoise
is found from South Carolina to Florida, and west as
far as Texas. It feeds on vegetation. It inhabits principally
the dry and sandy places and makes long burrows into which
it retires from the hot midday sun. The eggs of this tortoise
are buried in the sand and are hatched by the sun's
rays Agassiz's Tortoise, or the Desert Tortoise, is distributed
over the deserts of Arizona and southern California.</p>


<p class="hd5">The Soft-shelled Turtles.</p>

<p>The shells of these turtles are soft and the head has the
distinguishing characteristic of a pointed nose. They are
aquatic and are much like the snapping turtles in habit.
Large specimens can do damage with their sharp jaws.
They are popularly known as "flap jack turtles," and they
do not look unlike large pancakes. They are vicious and
can make severe wounds or injuries. Their food is the
same as that of the snapping turtles; in fact, they have so
many points in common that they are often called "soft-shelled
snapping turtles."</p>

<h2>THE CROCODILIA OR THE CROCODILES AND
ALLIGATORS.</h2>


<p>The Crocodiles and Alligators belong to that order of
reptiles known as Crocodilia. The Alligator's head is broad
and blunt; the Crocodile's is narrow and sharp.</p>

1. ALLIGATOR.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. CROCODILE.</div>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>The Alligators are distributed over the low and swampy
ground from North Carolina southward, but are becoming
rare almost to the point of extinction. Their skin is valued
and their eggs are sought as food so that they are annually
becoming rarer. They are afraid of man, but if cornered
will fight. Their jaws are large, powerful and provided
with strong teeth, capable of inflicting serious injury.
They feed on fish, animals and birds. Alligators make a
"bellowing" sound. The Crocodile is livelier and more
pugnacious than the Alligator, but there are no "man-eating"
Crocodiles in the United States.</p>

<h3>A SERIES OF BOOKS FOR BOYS</h3>

<p class="hd3">Which, in addition to the interesting boy scout stories by CAPTAIN ALAN<br />
DOUGLAS, Scoutmaster, contain articles on nature lore, native animals<br />
and a fund of other information pertaining to out-of-door life,<br />
that will appeal to the boy's love of the open</p>

<hr style='width: 15%; margin: 0 auto;' />

<p class="hd6">I. The Campfires of the Wolf Patrol</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Their first camping experience affords the scouts splendid opportunities to use
their recently acquired knowledge in a practical way. Elmer Chenowith, a lad
from the northwest woods, astonishes everyone by his familiarity with camp
life. A clean, wholesome story every boy should read.</p></div>


<p class="hd6">II. Woodcraft; or, How a Patrol Leader Made Good</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This tale presents many stirring situations in which some of the boys are called
upon to exercise all their ingenuity and unselfishness. A story filled with
healthful excitement.</p></div>


<p class="hd6">III. Pathfinder; or, The Missing Tenderfoot</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Some mysteries are cleared up in a most unexpected way, greatly to the credit
of our young friends. A variety of incidents follow fast, one after the other.</p></div>


<p class="hd6">IV. Fast Nine; or, a Challenge From Fairfield</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>They show the same team-work here as when in camp. The description of the
final game with the team of a rival town, and the outcome thereof, form a
stirring narrative. One of the best baseball stories of recent years.</p></div>


<p class="hd6">V. Great Hike; or, The Pride of The Khaki Troop</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>After weeks of preparation the scouts start out on their greatest undertaking.
Their march takes them far from home, and the good-natured rivalry of the
different patrols furnishes many interesting and amusing situations.</p></div>


<p class="hd6">VI. Endurance Test; or, How Clear Grit Won the Day</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Few stories "get" us more than illustrations of pluck in the face of apparent
failure. Our heroes show the stuff they are made of and surprise their most
ardent admirers. One of the best stories Captain Douglas has written.</p></div>

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
